* <a id="11:59.10">11:59.10 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: not sure what changed at Known Pro but I can't login, meaning when I do, the moment I choose a post type, I get logout
* <a id="11:59.44">11:59.44 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: it seems to be a conflict with SSL not being maintained at all time, so it kind of reset the sessions
* <a id="12:11.48">12:11.48 (GMT)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: working for me
* <a id="12:12.03">12:12.03 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: also it seems it broke all my connection to social media
* <a id="12:12.09">12:12.09 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: strange
* <a id="12:12.41">12:12.41 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i can't publish, I can login, but the moment I want to save something my session is dropped
* <a id="12:12.43">12:12.43 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yikes.
* <a id="12:29.49">12:29.49 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: rMdes: strange. Seems to be working for me. What happens when you try from another browser? If it's consistent, could you maybe record a network log so we can see what's going on?
* <a id="12:33.42">12:33.42 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: let me try, this is on firefox 57
* <a id="12:50.37">12:50.37 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I don't know how to record the network log
* <a id="12:52.44">12:52.44 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: the steps are : 1) login, I see the dashboard and I can go to any part of the admin site. 2) I pick a post type (status) type it, hit the publish button, I land on a Known page where I can try again, but it log me out, on the screen I can see "invalid token" - 3) I have to login again
* <a id="12:53.28">12:53.28 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: this is the insecure url : http://www.okcinfo.news/session/login
* <a id="12:54.00">12:54.00 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: it's the part of Known pro I really don't like : SSL cert is never green-checked because the cert is not for the domain
* <a id="12:54.58">12:54.58 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: The certificate is only valid for the following names: *.withknown.com, withknown.com
* <a id="12:55.29">12:55.29 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I can add an exception though : https://www.okcinfo.news/
* <a id="12:56.10">12:56.10 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: anyway it's a mess, i guess moving to self-hosted will be simpler to fix
* <a id="12:56.17">12:56.17 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I have no issue with self hosted sites
* <a id="13:08.37">13:08.37 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Yeah, sounds like a TLS/non-TLS cookie problem. Login will be directed to HTTPS, and then it sounds like you're being forwarded to non-tls afterwards and so the cookie is no longer available when you post your status update
* <a id="13:09.02">13:09.02 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Cookies on TLS are not available to non-TLS sessions
* <a id="13:09.06">13:09.06 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: thing is I usually never use HTTPS for this site since they don't match
* <a id="13:09.18">13:09.18 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i was getting log out from the non HTTPS site
* <a id="13:10.14">13:10.14 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: the site was built without using HTTPS on the custom page menu url for ex
* <a id="13:10.37">13:10.37 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: so the logic would be If i login without HTTPS I should stay HTTP the whole time
* <a id="13:10.59">13:10.59 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: and there should be no cookies collusion right ?
* <a id="13:11.12">13:11.12 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: hmm... sorry, I misunderstood
* <a id="13:12.08">13:12.08 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I'm confused too
* <a id="13:12.16">13:12.16 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: "invalid token" isn't necessarily anything to do with being logged out (if you can refresh the page and see the logged in menu, you haven't been logged out) that's the XSS validation failing on post
* <a id="13:12.18">13:12.18 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: that doesnt help
* <a id="13:12.44">13:12.44 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: so, the token generated by the form... for some reason... is being rejected when it's posted
* <a id="13:13.27">13:13.27 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: off the top of my head I can't think of a reason why this would happen, and I'd need to see the logs to really get a handle on why.
* <a id="13:14.17">13:14.17 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'll see if I can push some debug or something to see if we can get some client side output to help...
* <a id="13:14.34">13:14.34 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: thanks a lot
* <a id="13:14.45">13:14.45 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: sadly i can't provide more info, since I don't have access
* <a id="13:15.33">13:15.33 (GMT)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: the SSL is another issue then, has nothing to do with the token being invalidated, if I understood correctly
* <a id="13:16.14">13:16.14 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: aye... ssl certs being invalid is another issue...

* <a id="15:22.37">15:22.37 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: the token is generated over site secrete + action + time + _session id_ ... so maybe if the form is generated on https but posted to http, then it's not beyond the realms of possibility that the session id has changed, although I've no real data here. network log might help with this (chrome dev console allows you to record, ff might as well)

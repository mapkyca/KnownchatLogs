* <a id="17:09.11">17:09.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'm running the latest stable release on my site, and I'm not particularly excited about running my site directly off of the latest version in git.
* <a id="17:24.22">17:24.22 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: *dgold is staying on .9.1*
* <a id="17:28.26">17:28.26 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: @mapkyca: regarding releases, I feel it's worth mentioning I've had several people ask if Known is a live project based on the long period between releases and low activity on the Known social stream and blog.
* <a id="17:29.43">17:29.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've heard the same.
* <a id="17:30.06">17:30.06 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: what do you suppose is an indicator of a project being alive based on release schedule?
* <a id="17:30.23">17:30.23 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: is there some time limit? is it just "regular" at any interval?
* <a id="17:33.57">17:33.57 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its hard to say. Its sort of a soft, subjective thing.
* <a id="17:34.19">17:34.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I think a project like Known that hasn't had an official release in over a year definitely raises eyebrows, though.
* <a id="17:34.45">17:34.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'd guess a reasonable rule of thumb would be something on the order of 2-3 releases a year at a minimum.
* <a id="17:35.11">17:35.11 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Known had fairly regular releases up to 9.1, released 9.2 but didn't do a release post for it, and since then have had lots of action in Github but not much on their blog. The last post is listed as being published "about a year ago" and the last release is also.
* <a id="17:35.53">17:35.53 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: If I didn't know better, I would also conclude that an organisation that has not done any releases or social media for around a year would look somewhat like it was dead or on life support.
* <a id="17:37.22">17:37.22 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I love Known as a project, I'm not trying to be terrible or unappreciative here. Absent github and IRC activity I would assume that, though, and 99.9% of potential users aren't going to look at either.
* <a id="17:38.16">17:38.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Combine that with the current inability to sign up for hosted Known as an individual or any obvious signposting to where to do so, and it is not really something that is going to look like it is aimed at appealing to individual users.
* <a id="17:38.19">17:38.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Same here, love the project, and very much value the activity and work that's going on üôÇ
* <a id="17:38.45">17:38.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: To be fair, I think that the realities of building a viable business around the project have moved the focus to groups.
* <a id="17:39.10">17:39.10 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That said, I think there's huge benefit to the project and the business to attract more users.
* <a id="17:39.39">17:39.39 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Yes. But even then, a release schedule and occasional blog posts also signal health to institutional buyers.
* <a id="17:40.27">17:40.27 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: If I was looking at site licences, at present I'd have concerns...and that's not how I want Known to look, because I think it's an important project.
* <a id="17:40.28">17:40.28 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Very true.
* <a id="17:43.26">17:43.26 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: IMHO (and, again, this is intended to be instructive criticism) devoting a couple of hours a week to edtech social updates and/or posts talking about new features being developed would both potentially bring in press/eyeballs/sales leads and serve as a proof of life/interest. The ROI seems potentially good.
* <a id="17:44.02">17:44.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: That is why pretty much every startup does social. Given the project aims of Known, it's a little unfortunate that it isn't doing the same.
* <a id="17:44.31">17:44.31 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: There's a really big use case for people that want to share, and a set of potential buyers that are into social and edtech.
* <a id="17:45.15">17:45.15 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: But yeah, at the least I would say that from outside it looks like leaving the blog completely unmaintained is a bad plan, because it makes things look unattended in general.
* <a id="17:54.27">17:54.27 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: *dgold would have to throw in a quiet agreement*
* <a id="17:54.49">17:54.49 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: even if all the post is saying is looking over some PRs, that shows movement
* <a id="17:56.10">17:56.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: and I know that (c) tags are non-important from a legal PoV, but seeing a (c)2016 on a project page isn't ever welcoming
* <a id="17:57.58">17:57.58 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I don't, otoh, see point releases as anything significant - i look at a github repo and I see activity in $period, that's good

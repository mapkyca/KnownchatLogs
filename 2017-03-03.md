* <a id="11:21.12">11:21.12 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Morning
* <a id="12:02.33">12:02.33 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Dgold: I made the mistake of not cloning the Known repo when I set up my new Stream, I really ought to bo back and rectify that. It would make life a lot easier going forward. Especially now that Known has reverted back from quill.js
* <a id="12:16.02">12:16.02 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: oh, have they?
* <a id="12:16.18">12:16.18 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: jeremycherfas: you mist tell me if htey ever sort out the likes/bookmarks
* <a id="12:17.10">12:17.10 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Looking at your RSS feed, I see that the link for a like has an i of class=“fa fa-star” but that doesn’t seem to render in my feed reader (newsblur). So that might defeat the purpose, for me.
* <a id="12:17.50">12:17.50 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I might be better off creating different RSS feeds for different things, which is reasonably easy with the plugin I am using to display the stream in Grav.
* <a id="12:18.02">12:18.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: They have. I will.

* <a id="19:30.04">19:30.04 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/cleverdevil">@cleverdevil</a>] @keithjgrant when I first installed it, @withknown the biz had a more general purpose focus. They pivoted toward educators. (http://twtr.io/1P7iinifphQ)
* <a id="19:30.31">19:30.31 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/cleverdevil">@cleverdevil</a>] @keithjgrant that said, @withknown remains open source and is still worked on and a nice platform for personal sites as well. (http://twtr.io/1P7im7QBqFV)
* <a id="19:40.55">19:40.55 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/keithjgrant">@keithjgrant</a>] @cleverdevil So you host & manage the install yourself? I was hoping for a 2-min setup as a dummy site to test my MP client @withknown (http://twtr.io/1P7jhGmRVJy)
* <a id="19:53.35">19:53.35 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/cleverdevil">@cleverdevil</a>] @keithjgrant @withknown yes, I have a @DreamHost #DreamCompute virtual machine running Ubuntu that I quickly installed it on. Pretty easy. (http://twtr.io/1P7kqcHHqrj)
* <a id="20:48.14">20:48.14 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: hey all, I am trying to protect my Known site with an .htacess and .htpassword file.
* <a id="20:48.57">20:48.57 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: I tried adding the required code to the .htacess file that is already part of the known installation
* <a id="20:49.35">20:49.35 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: the site now does indeed ask for a password and login, but then throws back an 'Internal Server Error'
* <a id="20:50.07">20:50.07 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: what is the correct way to add the required .htaccess code to the .htacess file?
* <a id="20:50.14">20:50.14 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: *dosch[m] sent a long message: dosch[m]_2017-03-03_20:50:13.txt - https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/NHvQKZfRtyQALXCGpCNpBvmU*

Want to dig back into it tonight if possible (http://twtr.io/1P7xr6xDczU)

* <a id="11:58.44">11:58.44 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: jeremycherfas: Mapkyca I have Known connected to Twitter. Quill posts fine to Known, but does not show the Syndication targets. Is there a way to have Known respond in the way outlined here https://quill.p3k.io/docs/syndication
* <a id="13:09.36">13:09.36 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: jeremycherfas: not natively I think, but I think there are a number of micropub issues outstanding, you could see if it's one of those and file it if that's not the case
* <a id="13:11.30">13:11.30 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OK. Iâ€™m still in this odd position of having a working site hosted where I cannot easily access anything and a development site locally that I am trying to understand. Not sure I can expose the local site to internet access.
* <a id="18:04.13">18:04.13 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Dgold Not that I know of but mapkyca will be able to tell you.
* <a id="19:32.53">19:32.53 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Yeah, I'd be happy to talk to them
* <a id="19:33.04">19:33.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Right now, I'm concerned about the information in that techlifeweb article.
* <a id="19:42.03">19:42.03 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: jeremycherfas I installed the Twitter Plugin, followed all the instructions... no dice
* <a id="19:48.51">19:48.51 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: never mind. Access level hadn't been updated on twitter's servers
* <a id="19:58.11">19:58.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: All good now?
* <a id="20:00.00">20:00.00 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: I'm still trying to work out the best combination of Known for micro stuff, because it is so good with #indieweb and my main site, which uses Grav CMS. chrisaldrich has a pretty good set up using Known and WP that I am treating as a kind of model.
* <a id="20:20.37">20:20.37 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: I attempted to use WP on a subdomain - everything worked, and seemed better than known in many ways
* <a id="20:20.46">20:20.46 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: **but** its still WP.
* <a id="20:20.59">20:20.59 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: and its ugly as sin, and I can't stand it.
* <a id="20:21.49">20:21.49 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: I can live with (but would prefer to customise) the known themes
* <a id="20:34.45">20:34.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: I'd been wondering why a Twitter-Syndicated post wasn't showing a Twitter Icon on the homepage. I guess that's something to do with the installation order per the techlifeweb post

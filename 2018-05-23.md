* <a id="14:55.03">14:55.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OwnYourGram puts the word â€œArray" in the text when there's a hashtag. But there doesn't seem to be any way to delete that word from the post. Any clues?
* <a id="17:17.20">17:17.20 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: jeremycherfas: that sounds like Known isn't expecting the tags to be an array so it's converting it to a string
* <a id="17:17.31">17:17.31 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: I thought Known handled that properly though, when did this change?
* <a id="17:19.21">17:19.21 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I'm not honestly sure. I think that is indeed the problem, looking at the logs.
* <a id="17:20.14">17:20.14 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: But currently no time to look. The logs suggest the error is coming from the photo plugin template file.
* <a id="20:41.00">20:41.00 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: jeremycherfas: Yeah, looks like the template isn't handling situations where tags are present - the engine handles tag arrays (although we've switched to #hashtags rather than formal tags) but it looks like the template wasn't changed from the historic string.

* <a id="21:35.37">21:35.37 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Will do. Thanks very much.

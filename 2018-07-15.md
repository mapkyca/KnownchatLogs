I know stripping the commercial tools (Convoy) was in roadmap before the version 1.0 release. Wonder if that is it. You can add idno plugins to restore your sharing features.

The changes to the API meant http://Brid.gy (which does syndication and backfeed) had to be deprecated. LinkedIn still works for me, as does Twitter, but I did have the paid Convoy.

Last time I paid for Convoy was November. Thus, I assume it should be working. Or did Convoy get scrapped? I cannot remember. cc: @mapkyca @benwerd @erinjo (http://twtr.io/1g44A7K_xZx)

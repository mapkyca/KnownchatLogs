* <a id="18:57.54">18:57.54 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: is there a directory of Known instances? like this directory of Mastodon instances? https://instances.mastodon.xyz/ (e.g. that one could add their own Known instance too?)
* <a id="20:48.10">20:48.10 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Pretty happy with my Food plugin, after using it for a few days now: https://cleverdevil.io/content/food/
* <a id="20:48.13">20:48.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I still have a bug where the syndication toggles show up on publish, but don't actually seem to work.
* <a id="20:48.21">20:48.21 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If there's anyone who feels like taking a look, let me know!
* <a id="21:16.38">21:16.38 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: tanted: how would a directory of Known instances be useful? I get it for GNU_social and Mastodon because they're federated.

* <a id="21:17.22">21:17.22 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: tantek: Maybe a massive list of indieweb "federated" sites, but ultimately that would be too huge to be useful?
* <a id="21:17.58">21:17.58 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: it could certainly be an interesting thing to have built into a /reader.
* <a id="21:27.08">21:27.08 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I suspect there are some Universities running a "group" version of Known that people could join. And of course the original version of withknown.com allowed one to sign up for subdomains.... But I think they were mostly modeled as standalone sites.
* <a id="21:28.09">21:28.09 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: considers spinning up a Known instance which anyone could sign up for...
* <a id="21:33.52">21:33.52 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: A members-only Known site might be a great place for IndieWeb community interactions and discussion.
* <a id="21:34.14">21:34.14 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Something more long-lived than IRC/Slack.
* <a id="21:37.12">21:37.12 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: maybe stream.indieweb.org?
* <a id="21:48.22">21:48.22 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: The only one I've seen in the wild was https://teach.kqed.org/, but it appears to have been pretty locked down.

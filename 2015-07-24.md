* 00:12.26 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benwerd: check the logs. But it looks like the problem's with the in (...) queries.
* 00:12.29 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: enjoy :)
* 00:13.28 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: in that you were ooot, so read https://github.com/mapkyca/KnownchatLogs/blob/master/2015-07-23.md
* 10:31.46 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Further to last night's chat, and for the record (since everyone on the west coast is sleeping), it seems to be a problem with the content filter of the homepage
* 10:32.45 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: so, the default is for "filtered" but essentially everything permitted. If you have a lot of items in the entity_subtype in (...) query, mysql seems to ignore the index and does a full table scan
* 10:33.45 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: limiting type or selecting "all content" doesn't produce this error
* 10:34.02 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: So my thoughts are that this query needs to be rewritten somewhat
* 14:14.49 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: ok... may have been a red herring, we're into a case where the internal optimizer was deciding it was best to do a full search rather than use the interface.
* 15:11.24 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: good morning
* 15:11.41 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: I loaded up my local database with 28k random status updates
* 15:12.10 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: if I run  select * from entities left join metadata md on md.entity=entities.uuid where entity_subtype in ('IdnoPlugins\\Status\\Status', 'IdnoPlugins\\Text\\Text', 'IdnoPlugins\\Event\\Event') order by created desc limit 10;
* 15:12.14 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: it's pretty much instant
* 15:12.48 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: If I change it to "select distinct", it takes 2-5 seconds
* 15:14.03 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: and based on explain, it uses only a temporary table for the distinct query
* 15:35.20 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm wondering if we need the distinct at all...
* 15:36.30 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: certainly not on things like getRecordByUUID, where there can only ever be one
* 15:36.41 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (not that that one really matters)
* 15:38.51 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: I wouldn't think you need it on getRecords either?
* 15:38.57 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: select distinct *...
* 15:39.28 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: although wait, the site itself loads fine
* 15:39.33 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: 1.2 seconds
* 15:40.57 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: when executing the query on my large db (just imported my flickr archive as test), neither queries take long to execute.
* 15:41.40 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: although it's probably the result is being cached
* 15:41.45 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: hmmm...
* 15:42.40 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: still dont think this explains mark's issues, because we're talking seconds here...
* 15:42.52 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: s/seconds/milliseconds
* 16:14.16 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: yeah I don't know what's up. I can't reproduce > 1 second queries
* 16:16.37 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: well, this does take 2.5 seconds, but I cannot reproduce through the actual web app `select distinct * from entities left join metadata md on md.entity=entities.uuid where entity_subtype in ('IdnoPlugins\\Status\\Status', 'IdnoPlugins\\Text\\Text', 'IdnoPlugins\\Event\\Event') order by created desc limit 10;`
* 16:36.28 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: it's hard to benchmark since the dbms will cache the query for the next time, so it's hard to say whether it's your query that's improved or just that it was cached
* 16:37.17 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: tbh I think there's something else going on at his end, and short of actually getting shell on his box I'm not entirely sure what can be done...
* 16:37.40 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: maybe in the future we could put some benchmarking in on the unit tests, but that's probably a bit of a sledgehammer right now
* 16:42.00 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh boy you're right, if i clear the query cache, it's more like 5 seconds to render the homepage
* 16:51.18 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: lol, and adding indexes for created, entity.uuid, and metadata.entity makes it much worse
* 16:59.25 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: possibly because it gives it another index to populate from scratch on the first pass
* 17:02.29 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh
* 17:02.36 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: clearly I don't understand how databases work...
* 17:03.21 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I think this is one of the reasons why there's so much antipathy for them amongst many #indiewebcamp folk ;)
* 17:03.50 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: people do this kind of shit professionally, and get paid very well ;)

* 17:40.42 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: create a new db install, sign up as the admin user with the same username as previously
* 17:40.43 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: then
* 17:40.49 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: bring over the entities and the metadata tables.

* 17:42.10 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: make sure you're logged out of known first
* 17:42.21 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: is it on the same db server or a different one?
* 17:42.33 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: a03f:16e1:8100:8e73:6eff:fe75:52ef PRIVMSG #knownchat :it's same server
* 17:43.08 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: so you _should_ be able - if you're logged in with a db user with high enough permissions - to just drop entities and metadata from the new db and copy them from the old

* 17:43.51 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benborges: use newdb; create table entities select * from olddb.entities;
* 17:44.08 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: assuming they're both existing databases
* 17:44.26 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: or you could create an old db from a source dump.sql
* 17:45.18 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: and do the same for metadata
* 17:45.45 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: that brings across selected tables.
* 17:45.52 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I want two things to happen to the import / export code eventually: 1. export as WordPress XML, so you can take your content and migrate to WP etc if you want. 2.

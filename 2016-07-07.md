* <a id="10:03.55">10:03.55 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: Known installed and working over here. I need to import some content preferably from twitter and identica and I need to learn more about known as I've hit one little accessibility related issue so far. Some options in the user settings as well as the site management can't be toggled using the keyboard alone. Those are Yes / No style options.
* <a id="10:29.15">10:29.15 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: hmmm. Looking to the generated html, these are HTML checkboxes. Instead of clasic toggle they are showing On Off or Yes No text. Perhaps this is themed somehow.

* <a id="10:55.39">10:55.39 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: Heh, hopefully that'll be my first post on my new site :-)
* <a id="10:57.35">10:57.35 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: pvagner, great, and maybe even add something in the wiki ? https://indieweb.org/Known#Setup_Known_on_nginx
* <a id="10:59.55">10:59.55 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: First I do need to overcome that thingy with inaccessible toggles. I've found known uses bootstrap components along with bootstrap-accessibility plugin loaded and working. It also uses bootstrap-toggle and this is where my trouble starts being noticeable. Hopefuly I just have to enable accessibility support for bootstrap-toggle somewhere because otherwise this will turn into a bigger issue affecting other sites and
* <a id="10:59.56">10:59.56 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: services I'm afraid.
* <a id="11:01.17">11:01.17 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I think you should ask the community on the google group
* <a id="11:01.38">11:01.38 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: higher chance to get answer from some of the main coders there
* <a id="11:01.57">11:01.57 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: here is the link : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev
* <a id="11:25.59">11:25.59 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: hmmm. Still looking it up. It appears there is no immediate solution to this... https://github.com/minhur/bootstrap-toggle/issues/120
* <a id="11:31.26">11:31.26 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: Ah yes... some potential progress... https://github.com/minhur/bootstrap-toggle/issues/85
* <a id="11:51.00">11:51.00 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: And finally at least a way to be able to toggle the value using keyboard only. This is still not working for me unfortunatelly: https://github.com/minhur/bootstrap-toggle/pull/107
* <a id="11:51.25">11:51.25 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I wish someone from Known was here to help you

* <a id="11:51.47">11:51.47 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: have you tried the google group ?
* <a id="11:52.18">11:52.18 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: also considering we are all on different timezone, a reply might take some time to land in your inbox
* <a id="12:10.20">12:10.20 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: Oh excuse me. I'll most likely end up posting to the google group the way you've suggested, however I would like to make sure I did my job correctly when trying to research it initially.
* <a id="15:36.08">15:36.08 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: okay, dirty hack, I have just removed bootstrap-toggle from the default template and I'm happy now.

* <a id="16:18.24">16:18.24 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Bushmills? That's a protestant whiskey!
* <a id="16:19.02">16:19.02 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Guinness is pretty flavourless. The other stouts - Murphy's in particular - have more rounded flavours

* <a id="23:21.45">23:21.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Awesome, that'll come in useful if I actually get around to starting that IndieWeb podcast I am thinking of ðŸ˜‰
* <a id="23:23.23">23:23.23 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: This also makes me want to re-iterate my desire for an updated release of Known.
* <a id="23:23.54">23:23.54 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Lots of progress seems to have been made since 0.9.2.
* <a id="23:25.34">23:25.34 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: is that something a community member can do? (other than actually launch it as an official release on github)
* <a id="23:26.09">23:26.09 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I don't think so, no.
* <a id="23:26.22">23:26.22 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I mean, not without acting as a fork, which actually might not be a bad idea at this point.
* <a id="23:27.30">23:27.30 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i just mean is there some amount of prep of the release that's a lot of work that is making ben take a while to do it, that someone else could help with?
* <a id="23:27.44">23:27.44 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I recall kylewm saying that a new release would be dropping sometime shortly. I think it's now been more than a year since 0.9.2 was released.
* <a id="23:27.57">23:27.57 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: like if all he had to do was merge a PR that prepped the release....?
* <a id="23:28.06">23:28.06 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: But that was also before benwerd made his most recent change.
* <a id="23:29.02">23:29.02 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: To be fair, there's plenty of activity going on in GitHub, and I know that there's at least one major change (moving from TinyMCE to Quill) that just landed recently.
* <a id="23:29.14">23:29.14 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: oh yeah that keeps confusing me
* <a id="23:29.19">23:29.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It might just need to bake for a little bit more before release.
* <a id="23:29.23">23:29.23 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i keep forgetting that there's an HTML editor widget called Quill.js
* <a id="23:29.33">23:29.33 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, its - https://quilljs.com
* <a id="23:29.34">23:29.34 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: ðŸ™‚
* <a id="23:29.52">23:29.52 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i don't feel too bad tho because we launched right around the same time
* <a id="23:29.59">23:29.59 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I think that major change to quill may have been rolled back to TinyMCE again, though some may be playing around with it.
* <a id="23:29.59">23:29.59 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: nods.
* <a id="23:30.47">23:30.47 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'm (hopefully) going to be moving exclusively to posting longer-form posts via `vim` in the next month or two.
* <a id="23:30.58">23:30.58 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, I don't care too much about TinyMCE vs. Quill anyway ðŸ˜‰
* <a id="23:31.22">23:31.22 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: maybe i should integrate the quill.js editor into my quill just to confuse things
* <a id="23:31.59">23:31.59 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: aaronpk, are you considering making it 200 days of indieweb? ðŸ˜‰
* <a id="23:32.05">23:32.05 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: ahhhhhhhh no
* <a id="23:32.18">23:32.18 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Haha
* <a id="23:32.20">23:32.20 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: nice
* <a id="23:32.21">23:32.21 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: 100 days is enough!
* <a id="23:32.38">23:32.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: two 100 days projects simultaneously can certainly burn you out...
* <a id="23:33.00">23:33.00 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: interestingly i would not describe what i'm currently feeling as "burnout"
* <a id="23:33.38">23:33.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'm also seriously considering starting to work on the NextCloud News app to make it an IndieWeb-reader (with the ability to post to my site via micropub).
* <a id="23:33.52">23:33.52 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: that sounds great
* <a id="23:34.05">23:34.05 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its a very good starting point.
* <a id="23:34.16">23:34.16 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Much more modern than most of the other feed aggregators and readers out there.
* <a id="23:34.31">23:34.31 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Only major downside for me right now is that it doesn't support the Fever API.
* <a id="23:35.23">23:35.23 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: feed /reader s are certainly a major missing piece of the indieweb.
* <a id="23:36.30">23:36.30 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: though if some of the "commercial" readers would support micropub, that issue might disappear as an itch for many
* <a id="23:36.43">23:36.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I actually think they're also one of the biggest market opportunities.
* <a id="23:37.08">23:37.08 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i'm still unsatisfied with how existing readers work in general, for similar reasons as to why i shut down Monocle
* <a id="23:37.24">23:37.24 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its sort of why I think Micro.blog is so important â€“Â its essentially providing both critical mass of compliant IndieWeb sites *and* a simple IndieWeb-compliant reader.
* <a id="23:37.39">23:37.39 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: that's a great point
* <a id="23:37.43">23:37.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: What are your major concerns?
* <a id="23:38.37">23:38.37 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i've written about it a little. here's why I shut down Monocle: https://aaronparecki.com/2016/04/26/3/monocle
* <a id="23:38.51">23:38.51 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: and here's what I was using instead, and continue to use: https://aaronparecki.com/2015/08/29/8/why-i-live-in-irc
* <a id="23:39.58">23:39.58 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: maybe if i start thinking about the problem as like you said, providing indieweb sites *and* a reader
* <a id="23:40.02">23:40.02 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Right, we discussed that a bit when I was in PDX, that's a super interesting way to consume content.
* <a id="23:41.01">23:41.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: If you think about it, most of the popular social silos are really readers first and content posting interfaces a distant second.
* <a id="23:41.04">23:41.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: The integrated experience is pretty critical, I think.
* <a id="23:41.08">23:41.08 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Removes a lot of the friction.
* <a id="23:41.21">23:41.21 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Exactly, chrisaldrich, most of these silos are consume-first.
* <a id="23:41.25">23:41.25 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I was always surprised that WordPress didn't have a built in reader prominently included in their product.
* <a id="23:41.34">23:41.34 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i don't think your actual website needs to also be a reader, but whatever reader you use absolutely has to be able to post to your website
* <a id="23:41.58">23:41.58 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yes, and actually WordPress.com has something like this, IIRC.
* <a id="23:42.16">23:42.16 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: aaronpk, I think that's part of the popularity of feedly, the ability to quickly/easily crosspost to social silos.
* <a id="23:42.31">23:42.31 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: hm i'm not super familiar with feedly, maybe i should check it out
* <a id="23:43.16">23:43.16 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: There are plenty of good desktop apps that do this as well, including Reeder.
* <a id="23:43.19">23:43.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Oh, and ReadKit,
* <a id="23:43.33">23:43.33 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Feedly was one of the big winners when google reader shut down. It's probably got the largest list of features in its competitive group.
* <a id="23:43.47">23:43.47 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I don't think its quite enough, but getting some of these aggregators/readers to support IndieWeb would be huge.
* <a id="23:47.38">23:47.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: supporting micropub would be a huge first step certainly.

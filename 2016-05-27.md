The channel is pretty quiet right now, so I thought I'd say hello, and ping some people (like benwerd, mapkyca, and kylewm) that you're here.  If no one responds for a while, try posting on our development mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev or just try coming back later.

* <a id="16:57.37">16:57.37 (BST)</a> - __[Sriperi](https://github.com/Sriperi)__: Hi! So I installed known on my server the other day and setup twitter, bridgy. It seems to receive the webmention but for some reason is not able to 'handle' it. The error log says 'error - Could not find handler for  <Post link>'
* <a id="16:58.33">16:58.33 (BST)</a> - __[Sriperi](https://github.com/Sriperi)__: Anything specific that I should be looking out for?
* <a id="17:02.24">17:02.24 (BST)</a> - __[Sriperi](https://github.com/Sriperi)__: Not quite sure if it really matters, but i installed known in a sub directory of my domain..

* <a id="17:15.20">17:15.20 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: IMO welcome bot should only say that when someone speaks for the first time, not just joining
* <a id="17:15.58">17:15.58 (BST)</a> - __[Speri](https://github.com/Speri)__: Haha..this is my first time experience on the IRC..so welcome the bots welcome :)
* <a id="17:16.13">17:16.13 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: Sriperi, it's a good guess it has something to do with the subdirectory. Though I'm not immediately sure what
* <a id="17:18.24">17:18.24 (BST)</a> - __[Speri](https://github.com/Speri)__: Hmm..let me tinker with a proper install and see if that works..if it's a sub directory issue..shouldn't be that difficult to figure out te links I presume..
* <a id="18:34.55">18:34.55 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: re bot... might have a tinker, or find another... it *should* only welcome folk 1) if nobody says anything for a few minutes, and 2) someone joins who hasn't been welcomed before
* <a id="19:14.13">19:14.13 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: arronpk: Yeah, a welcome if someone speaks and nobody replies might be more sensible.

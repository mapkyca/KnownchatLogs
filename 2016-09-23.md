* <a id="12:18.14">12:18.14 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: my understanding is that Ben and Erin are basically just very very busy at the moment, that's all. No great conspiracy ;)

* <a id="23:25.46">23:25.46 (BST)</a> - __[Torsten_](https://github.com/Torsten_)__: Hi, I have a question regarding static pages in Known. It seems like no more than 10 pages per category are shown in the backend and frontend, even when there were more of them created and can be found in the database. I cannot find any code in the plugin files that limits the output. Any ideas anybody?
* <a id="23:30.53">23:30.53 (BST)</a> - __[Torsten_](https://github.com/Torsten_)__: Wrote an email to the Known support. Bye for now.

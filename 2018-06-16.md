* <a id="10:16.22">10:16.22 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: You mean link to the unofficial builds from the "official" readme in the package? :D ... I wouldn't want to step on any toes with Ben or Erin, so I personally wouldn't. A link from e.g. the Indieweb known entry though is probably ok if someone were to do that...
* <a id="10:20.10">10:20.10 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: Yeah from the "official" readme. Its just a new build from the code there...
* <a id="10:20.26">10:20.26 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: It helps an pushes known in general
* <a id="10:20.58">10:20.58 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: I could create pr and ping all "important" people?
* <a id="10:43.30">10:43.30 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: flawless update. Thx mapkyca!
* <a id="13:47.26">13:47.26 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Gomez: No worries, glad it worked out!
* <a id="13:56.25">13:56.25 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: Is there a good way to add a video on an known site? Without youtube/vimeo...
* <a id="13:57.23">13:57.23 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Hidden secret, the audio plugin still supports video, but you need to do the transcoding yourself (which is complicated, which is why the support was removed).
* <a id="13:58.39">13:58.39 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: There's a transcoding plugin (https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2017/11/02/video-transcoding-in-known/) ... but it might have suffered bitrot, as it's a little tricky to set up (ffmpeg codecs etc)
* <a id="13:59.21">13:59.21 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: Ok, thanks.  transcoding is too much, i can prepare the video.
* <a id="13:59.55">13:59.55 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: the html5 video element could work? If i add it in the source?
* <a id="14:05.10">14:05.10 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: It should pick up that video is there when you upload the video. The only issue is that encoding a video to play across browsers and screens is actually fairly hard and configuring codecs is basically witchcraft. This was why it was removed.
* <a id="14:16.14">14:16.14 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: k, thanks for the info.
* <a id="19:56.00">19:56.00 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: Just do h264, that's good for most browsers. If you have a link too they can click through to something else that plays it.
* <a id="20:33.12">20:33.12 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: video support in browsers has gotten way better the last few years. it's nowhere near the witchcraft it used to be.

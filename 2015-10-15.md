* <a id="00:05.54">00:05.54 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: (the "I have to create yet another account?!? UX barrier")

* <a id="00:14.03">00:14.03 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: perhaps I can practice with up to 3 and see how that works
* <a id="00:17.26">00:17.26 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: is the scope of the account the specific x . withknown.com site? or is it a "withknown" account that they can then use on other withknown.com sites?

* <a id="21:46.04">21:46.04 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: not that I know of. iirc, they just recently switched to a new frontend model that's not so tightly tied to bootstrap
* <a id="21:46.22">21:46.22 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: so hopefully that will spur theme developers to get into it!
* <a id="22:09.12">22:09.12 (BST)</a> - __[dosch](https://github.com/dosch)__: yeah, would be really nice to have some more choices. Anyway, I really like where Known is going. Already use it on four websites and considering to move my main blog from WordPress to Known :-)

* <a id="01:12.35">01:12.35 (BST)</a> - __[tanlaan](https://github.com/tanlaan)__: I've been looking over the facebook plugin source quite a bit today in search of a way to implement "check ins" for an actual location post for facebook. Very interesting to actually delve into some source code that could change the way I use something for the first time.
* <a id="01:13.55">01:13.55 (BST)</a> - __[tanlaan](https://github.com/tanlaan)__: Through in a pull request to change some formatting, and I'd need to test it but it seems like the images posting is able to actually post more than one image at a time, but the interface limits you to one upload at a time. I'm thinking I should be able to stop a few unneeded reference checks in that loop if there were more than one input.

* <a id="11:12.16">11:12.16 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: jeremycherfas, i think someone should check if that micropub syndication query works on a fresh known installation
* <a id="11:23.53">11:23.53 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I could maybe try that later today.
* <a id="11:24.13">11:24.13 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’ve also asked someone else I know who uses Known if they have problems.
* <a id="15:04.06">15:04.06 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Seems I can’t easily test that micropub query on my local clean install of Known, and I can’t easily do it on my server either without compromising my live install.
* <a id="19:34.22">19:34.22 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: !tell benwerd any thoughts or know anyone working on graphs over time of Known instances, posts per second, total posts, etc. like https://donp.org/graph/dashboard/db/mastodon?orgId=1&from=1491782295675&to=1496168974110 ?
* <a id="19:34.22">19:34.22 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next

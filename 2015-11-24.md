* <a id="03:49.09">03:49.09 (GMT)</a> - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: as in I want "/" to go straight into the stream of 4-6 users' content with no profiles shown

I was replying to your site, but the comment did not appear. First I thought it was a glitch, but when it happened again I reverted back to the 0.8.5 you provide on withknown.com. If it helps I can do it again and investigate logs and such.

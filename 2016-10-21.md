* <a id="03:11.33">03:11.33 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: that's a good tagline
* <a id="03:13.42">03:13.42 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: Yeah, I agree.  I've been thinking about using Known for something like "Day One" but making periodic posts public - keeping the majority private.
* <a id="03:15.04">03:15.04 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: Day One's tagline is "capture life as you live it"
* <a id="03:16.54">03:16.54 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: yes that's also very good
* <a id="03:17.08">03:17.08 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: Day One's UI might be good to screenshot / capture
* <a id="03:19.53">03:19.53 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: I also use Wallabag and it would be interesting to read things I've "saved" and then react to them with webmentions - reply, repost, etc.  Sort of like Medium's toolset.
* <a id="03:20.55">03:20.55 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: indeed!

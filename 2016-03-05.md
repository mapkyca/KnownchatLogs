* <a id="21:38.17">21:38.17 (GMT)</a> - __[Tino](https://github.com/Tino)__: Does anyone know what exactly is stored in the database? I'm trying to restore a post I accidentally deleted. I restored the entities with that uuid and the metadata. The page is loaded, but it contains nothing. I must be missing something...
* <a id="21:46.28">21:46.28 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: Tino: maybe the activitystreampost and its metadata for that entity?
* <a id="21:46.57">21:46.57 (GMT)</a> - __[Tino](https://github.com/Tino)__: Nevermind, I found it. Idno\Entities\ActivityStreamPost
* <a id="21:47.00">21:47.00 (GMT)</a> - __[Tino](https://github.com/Tino)__: Yeh, indeed
* <a id="21:47.02">21:47.02 (GMT)</a> - __[Tino](https://github.com/Tino)__: That's what was missing
* <a id="21:47.12">21:47.12 (GMT)</a> - __[Tino](https://github.com/Tino)__: I had copied the MetaData, but not the ActivityStreamPost one

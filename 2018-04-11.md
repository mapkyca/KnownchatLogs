* <a id="13:28.09">13:28.09 (BST)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: hey all, amidst the Facebook drama, I thought to use known to create a fast alternative for a FB group. But my only concern is the active development of the software. What is the current status of the software, is it being maintained, is there a roadmap?
* <a id="13:29.53">13:29.53 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: As a user, I can say that the latest Master is terrific, it does seem to be maintained and improved, and I am not aware of a roadmap.
* <a id="13:33.00">13:33.00 (BST)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: Thank you! The latest master has a red failing button on it... should that worry me? https://github.com/idno/Known

* <a id="13:36.44">13:36.44 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: You could try version 0.9.9 and wait for the tests to pass before going to Master?
* <a id="13:39.59">13:39.59 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: The red failing on test is currently down to something wrong with the travis build machine and mongo support. I've not had time to really get into it

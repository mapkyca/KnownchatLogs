* <a id="01:53.44">01:53.44 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: sensiblemn: [chrisaldrich] left you a message 6 days, 2 hours ago: I'm pretty sure I saw a thread in the Known-Dev google group about doing something like that. No one ended up building it, which didn't bode well for the idea. Like some others, I still think that IRC+wiki is the best way to help speed development and spread the information.
* <a id="03:52.19">03:52.19 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Do you think it'd be useful to anyone else, @sensiblemn?
* <a id="04:01.28">04:01.28 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: yes. we all build off of one another's work
* <a id="04:01.44">04:01.44 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: if you thought of it, others likely have/will as well.

* <a id="04:11.07">04:11.07 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i'm curious, did you read the emails from ben and erin? they suggested, amongst other things, changing the name of the free software project to idno, so as to differentiate from their business. i would love to see this community grow and i really like their idea. do you think we should try to organize people to start building a community idno website that we can all interact with via our personal idno sites?
* <a id="04:12.07">04:12.07 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i think that a central hub, where people are talking about idno, would be more fun than interacting only via google groups and irc
* <a id="04:13.03">04:13.03 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: As much as I'd love to see that happen, I think it really needs to be driven by Ben and Erin.
* <a id="04:14.27">04:14.27 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: !tell chrisaldrich. i get what you are saying. i like irc+wiki too, but felt like that was the best way to reach the most people. i also think that a Known/idno "hub" would be fun for all us Known/idno users. maybe i should suggest this on the wiki.
* <a id="04:14.59">04:14.59 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: why is that? they are saying that they aren't really looking to do that. they have a business to run.
* <a id="04:15.34">04:15.34 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That's a fair point.
* <a id="04:15.51">04:15.51 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'd be game for participating in such a thing.
* <a id="04:15.52">04:15.52 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i respect their desire to work the business while also contributing to the free software project. very honorable work they are doing.

* <a id="17:50.49">17:50.49 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Hello, Known folks!
* <a id="17:51.01">17:51.01 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Trying to create an endpoint in a plugin that responds to a webhook.
* <a id="17:51.03">17:51.03 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: https://gist.github.com/cleverdevil/e3fe357d3c4a84bfc71d2dd4958191c6
* <a id="17:51.33">17:51.33 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I can hit it with my test script, and it doesn't return any errors, but the post doesn't get created.
* <a id="17:51.47">17:51.47 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Any Known experts that could help, that would be awesome!
* <a id="19:11.56">19:11.56 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: No takers on advice on that issue?
* <a id="20:14.49">20:14.49 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: cleverdevil (and everyone else), While it's nice to interact here during the day for ease of use and community building, I suspect that most don't know the longer history of this particular chat channel.\
* <a id="20:15.18">20:15.18 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: It's only recently been bridged from the indieweb chat to Slack, but it was never really heavily (or at all?) used by many known devs.
* <a id="20:16.51">20:16.51 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: From the beginning they preferred to use https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev as their primary location for dev chat, so more dev heavy conversations may gain additional traction there over here where folks like benwerd, erinjorichey, and mapkyca are likely to see and respond.
* <a id="20:17.50">20:17.50 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Not that I want to see everyone flee, it's just a piece of historical data that the regulars here should know.
* <a id="20:19.30">20:19.30 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: In general, the folks here are indieweb users who have known installs, but know that by only posting here, you're missing a slightly larger community of devs who are chatting somewhere else. The Google group is more focused on Known, the CMS, and is less likely to be Indieweb focused, based on my experience. ðŸ™‚
* <a id="20:19.31">20:19.31 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: [chrisaldrich]: The API delivers already formatted HTML to your app. This isn't ideal since not all apps are based on HTML, but this is not fixable as it's part of the way OStatus federation works.
* <a id="20:19.38">20:19.38 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: ^^ mastodon
* <a id="20:20.05">20:20.05 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold
* <a id="20:20.22">20:20.22 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I suspect it was more involved, but hadn't dug into it yet myself.
* <a id="20:20.50">20:20.50 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: dgold that statement is a bit confusing
* <a id="20:20.56">20:20.56 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I'm personally hoping that mastodon steps outside of the GNU Status group in moving toward support for webmention.
* <a id="20:21.14">20:21.14 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: tantek: you think :)
* <a id="20:21.22">20:21.22 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: tantek: he was referring to something a day or two ago in the stream. ðŸ™‚
* <a id="20:21.36">20:21.36 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: *tantek will check archives. thanks*
* <a id="20:22.06">20:22.06 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: tantek: I was referring to a conversation on mastodon about creating a plugin for known->mastodon federation
* <a id="20:22.12">20:22.12 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I want to say it may be related to some posts about POSSE to Mastodon that happened the other day.
* <a id="20:22.46">20:22.46 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I thought it would be easier than it is - largely down to the lack of engagement withPHP in the mastodon dev world
* <a id="20:22.47">20:22.47 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: needs to catch up on logs for several rooms too
* <a id="20:23.32">20:23.32 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I've been hitting the mastodon api with httpie, and it all comes back as html, not as json structs like twitter, pnut, 10C &c
* <a id="20:23.34">20:23.34 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: dgold, indeed it would be better if Known could federate with Mastodon rather than duplicate content by POSSEing
* <a id="20:23.50">20:23.50 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: Known already federates with indieweb protocols
* <a id="20:24.02">20:24.02 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: that is indeed so.
* <a id="20:24.03">20:24.03 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold I had forgotten about the non-php nature of mastodon too... that throws a slightly larger wrench into the picture, though it's possible one could create a POSSE to GNU social which then bridges to mastodon that way too.
* <a id="20:24.03">20:24.03 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: which are frankly, simpler and more minimal than OStatus etc.
* <a id="20:24.10">20:24.10 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: (and more modern at this point)
* <a id="20:24.22">20:24.22 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: tantek: OStatus is _creaky_
* <a id="20:24.29">20:24.29 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: so it may be easier to get Mastodon to support indieweb protocols, and get Known<->Mastodon federation that way
* <a id="20:24.55">20:24.55 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: ben_thatmustbeme already got mf2 in Mastodon so that's a good start. Webmention would be a next logical choice
* <a id="20:25.15">20:25.15 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I think if we could talk Mastodon into more indiewebification, it could be a bigger bridge into a broader universe, as well as the ability to work with projects like micro.blog which are on the horizon
* <a id="20:25.16">20:25.16 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: oh, incidentally, i was chatting to the 10C dev recently - he really does seem to be interested in indieweb-style development going forward
* <a id="20:25.29">20:25.29 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: maybe better to say that over in #indieweb
* <a id="20:25.46">20:25.46 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold, that's great news!
* <a id="20:25.59">20:25.59 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: dgold definitely! perhaps even #indieweb-dev :)
* <a id="20:26.09">20:26.09 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Is he in #indieweb chat yet?
* <a id="20:26.28">20:26.28 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: he did pop by briefly, yes
* <a id="20:26.38">20:26.38 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I know he's in Japan which puts him in an odd timezone, but I'll be some of us would stay up late to help him out.
* <a id="20:26.47">20:26.47 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: but he's in .jp, and he's been having a pretty torrid time in his dayjob
* <a id="20:26.48">20:26.48 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: s/be/bet
* <a id="20:27.13">20:27.13 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: i'm looking for the comment he made, and will link to it when I find it
* <a id="20:28.49">20:28.49 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: If he builds in indieweb friendly pieces, he's already got the other platform pieces and it could be a great bridge to Gen2 and Gen3 users for Indieweb as a Service.

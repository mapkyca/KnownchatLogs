* 17:16.21 (BST) - __[travis-ci](https://github.com/travis-ci)__: Change view : https://github.com/mapkyca/idno/compare/8484b549c255...08f49b6960fc
* 17:16.21 (BST) - __[travis-ci](https://github.com/travis-ci)__: Build details : https://travis-ci.org/mapkyca/idno/builds/75294006
* 17:43.26 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: evenin' :)
* 18:35.56 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: hi
* 18:36.31 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: mapkyca: i was thinking about using your email to known plugin. are you still using it?
* 18:40.28 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: yep, although it needs a little bit of work - the posse stuff hasn't been updated to the new multi account code. Just haven't had time!
* 18:47.13 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: that's understandable.
* 19:17.46 (BST) - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: hmm, trying to set up the Editorial Micropub workflows, and I am not sure how I am supposed to get an IndieAuth token to paste in
* 19:18.09 (BST) - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: I can visit indieauth.com and authenticate, but I don't see anywhere to actually view and copy tokens.
* 21:24.36 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benwerd: thoughts... should we add a persistent login cookie?
* 21:25.06 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: oh hey benwerd do you want #withknown tweets in here?
* 21:25.15 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Not at all against it, although the sessions are _supposed_ to effectively do this (and do on a MySQL back-end)
* 21:25.25 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: aaronpk: Ooh! Is that easy to achieve?
* 21:25.29 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah actually
* 21:25.33 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: We're starting to see loads more tweets
* 21:25.47 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: it's gonna cause a bit of a flood when i first turn it on...
* 21:27.28 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benwerd: basically, *something* is timing out sessions, and since they're custom file based sessions (and so aren't rotated by the debian bug), however the old elgg persistent login code didn't have this problem
* 21:35.05 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I'd rather use PHP's built in sessions if we possibly can - but it might be worth picking through an established session handler. eg, figuring out what Symfony has here.
* 21:37.27 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: probably right, the elgg style cookie might not work here because you can't guarantee database session storage. Custom location file storage should be ok, however, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
* 21:37.37 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: Loqi++
* 21:37.39 (BST) - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Loqi has 368 karma

* 21:38.05 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: aaronpk++
* 21:38.07 (BST) - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: aaronpk has 932 karma

* 21:44.02 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: mapkyca: Loqi is already self-aware. I for one welcome our new IRC bot ruler.
* 21:45.11 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: what is Loqi?
* 21:45.25 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: she's not answering my questions.
* 21:48.10 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm guessing no wiki back end...
* 21:48.22 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: not here
* 21:48.25 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Also, as a robot, she maintains a steely reserve.
* 21:53.13 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: due to a config error on my part you will be happy to learn that the tweet flood will not occur here
* 21:53.59 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: benwerd: any other terms besides "withknown" you'd like to add to the search?
* 21:54.20 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I think withknown covers it (for now). Thank you!
* 21:54.41 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: kewl. now we wait
* 21:55.34 (BST) - __[ben_thatmustbeme](https://github.com/ben_thatmustbeme)__: ACTION pictures aaronpk with his hands in front of him with fingers touching glaring at the screen

* 21:56.34 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Testing:
* 21:57.14 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: ... or does it need to be a word on its own?
* 21:57.20 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: (rather than eg a component of a URL?)
* 21:57.51 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: I just see "Testing:"
* 21:58.47 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: normally the search api returns URL matches too
* 21:59.30 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: maybe not the streaming search api tho
* 22:01.50 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: hm no it looks like i'm missing something

* 22:19.12 (BST) - __[ben_thatmustbeme](https://github.com/ben_thatmustbeme)__: oh cool, you have a lot of schools switching?
* 22:19.33 (BST) - __[ben_thatmustbeme](https://github.com/ben_thatmustbeme)__: i would have loved that when i was in school
* 22:24.20 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: ben_thatmustbeme: Yes. We just signed [famous east coast Ivy League school]. Lots of people seeing that the LMS doesn't in any way support teaching.
* 22:24.59 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: We thought schools would want to give students their own sites, but actually, it turns out to be mostly Known as a community platform that's bringing in revenue. So we're adjusting our plans accordingly.

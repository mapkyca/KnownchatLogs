* 07:23.53 (BST) - __[scottJordan](https://github.com/scottJordan)__: Good morning from the UK, There seems to be a problem with my site this morning
* 07:25.04 (BST) - __[scottJordan](https://github.com/scottJordan)__: My header nav bar has increased in size and I am unable to see the nave menu in Site Configuration
* 08:06.58 (BST) - __[scottjordan](https://github.com/scottjordan)__: Ignore my previous message, my bad

* 19:45.37 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: It's my understanding that to use Woodwind, one needs to use IndieAuth and IndiePub, which only work on single user themed Known sites. Could I sort of hack this by putting <rel=me> type stuff in the custom javascript header or footer?
* 19:58.28 (BST) - __[KevinMarks_](https://github.com/KevinMarks_)__: not sure that will work if its adde to the page by JS, it needs to show up in the page
* 19:58.46 (BST) - __[KevinMarks_](https://github.com/KevinMarks_)__: but I think kylewm and ben are working on redirecting as part of logging in
* 20:05.00 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: cool, i thought i saw some discussion about working on redirecting, but i wasn't sure
* 23:23.06 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: hi, I moved my known instance to another server (same URL) and moved from Apache to nginx
* 23:23.27 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: I get some 404 on files which I had uploaded, although I restored my Uploads folder
* 23:23.39 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: do you have any leads on what the problem could be?
* 23:23.40 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: thanks
* 23:26.10 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: maybe some sort of rewrite something or other. i'm a n00b.
* 23:26.14 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: not really sure
* 23:26.17 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: sensiblemn: you can log into woodwind without any plugins, just rel=mes
* 23:26.28 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: you can use domain.com/profile/username as your identity on a multiuser site
* 23:27.27 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: kylewm: when using a multiuser site, and wanting to log in via twitter, does twitter have to link to domain.com/profile/username
* 23:27.29 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: ?
* 23:27.58 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: yeah it would
* 23:30.04 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i thought so, so in that circumstance, could I put the rel=me code into the custom header/footer plugin on Known?
* 23:30.13 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Phyks: inside the Uploads folder, there's a folder named after your domain. You may need to rename it to the new domain
* 23:30.38 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: benwerd: saw it, but my domain did not change
* 23:31.02 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: possibly a file permissions issue?
* 23:31.03 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: sensiblemn: you don't want to put the twitter url in your profile?
* 23:31.26 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i use a multiuser theme, but i only have one user on my site
* 23:32.02 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: ohh got it
* 23:32.03 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i want to put sensible.mn in my @sensiblemn twitter profile
* 23:32.48 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: I don't know the plugins well enough to say. if it requires javascript to render, then it wouldn't work with indieauth
* 23:34.03 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: ah, no worries then kylewm. i don't think it requires javascript to render though. i think you can just stick whatever code you want in there. i'll try it out and see how it goes. Woodwind is pretty awesome by the way
* 23:34.17 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: thanks! :)
* 23:35.59 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: hopefully once you log in, you'll be able to go to settings and select Micropub, and then reply and like stuff inline
* 23:36.41 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: yeah, i was able to easily log in and set up the micropub last night by changing my theme temporarily to single user
* 23:36.58 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i replied and liked stuff using it. pretty cool!
* 23:39.05 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i am curious, with twitter i get a notification thing on android anytime people mention me. is there a way to combine Woodwind with some XMPP PubHub thing to get custom alerts sent to you?
* 23:40.13 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: Or just in general, is there a way to view "mentions" in Woodwind?
* 23:42.55 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i'm just really interested in your reader. seeing it work is really exciting. consuming and publishing PuSH feeds all in one is super awesome.

* 23:58.28 (BST) - __[Phyks](https://github.com/Phyks)__: I think my rewriting with nginx is pretty bad

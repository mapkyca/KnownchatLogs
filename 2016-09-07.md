* <a id="21:55.41">21:55.41 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: Hi. I'm trying to connect my micropub client to my local known and get a "400 bad request"/"unrecognized code." response from known when trying to fetch the access token
* <a id="21:56.06">21:56.06 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: where does known store authorization codes?
* <a id="22:05.49">22:05.49 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: ok, found the bug - https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1504
* <a id="22:06.16">22:06.16 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: hmm
* <a id="22:06.22">22:06.22 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: why is the client verifying the auth code?
* <a id="22:06.29">22:06.29 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: to get the real "me" value
* <a id="22:06.33">22:06.33 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: it should be able to just exchange it for an access token before verifying it
* <a id="22:06.35">22:06.35 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: the final one
* <a id="22:06.37">22:06.37 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: s/before/without
* <a id="22:06.59">22:06.59 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: oh interesting... you actually need the token response to include the final "me" value then
* <a id="22:07.08">22:07.08 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: maybe not
* <a id="22:07.14">22:07.14 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: because the callback includes the "me" value
* <a id="22:07.46">22:07.46 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: and if the access token request (which contains me) is successful, then I could assume that the me value sent by the user is correct
* <a id="22:08.44">22:08.44 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: then I could skip auth code verification
* <a id="22:12.09">22:12.09 (BST)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: now it works. like and reply on known with shpub!

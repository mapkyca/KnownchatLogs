* <a id="06:50.45">06:50.45 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Anyone successfully posting from non-hosted micro.blog to Known?
* <a id="20:46.10">20:46.10 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: jeremycherfas I'm curious why you'd want to do it in that direction? I've been posting from Known to micro.blog via RSS.
* <a id="20:46.10">20:46.10 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Are you trying to recreate the same flow thei iOS app allows to both micro.blog and WordPress?
* <a id="20:57.41">20:57.41 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: chrisaldrich No good reason, but if it isn't even an option I am puzzled why it exists. It offers the opportunity to put in any URL that might have a micropub endpoint, but the on in Known isn't operational. I don't think. Who knows?
* <a id="20:58.16">20:58.16 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: oh do you mean just using the micro.blog iOS app to post to known?
* <a id="20:59.12">20:59.12 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Yes, precisely that.
* <a id="20:59.37">20:59.37 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: ah, that isn't even POSSE because the app talks directly to Known. That's just using the micro.blog app as a Micropub client
* <a id="21:00.02">21:00.02 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: I've been posting to my site from the iOS app, so it should work with Known
* <a id="21:00.38">21:00.38 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: knowing manton's wordpress background, I suspect the iOS app is using WordPress API methods to post there rather than micropub.
* <a id="21:00.51">21:00.51 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yes, it supports the wordpress API and also micropub
* <a id="21:02.25">21:02.25 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I haven't been using the iOS app much as my daily device is android. Did it have an option to post to micro.blog and micropub to another primary site?
* <a id="21:03.09">21:03.09 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I don't remember it having the option to do what you're talking about aaronpk...
* <a id="21:03.10">21:03.10 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: when you first go to make a new post, it asks where you want to post to. you can enter a hosted micro.blog username, a wordpress site, or a url that supports micropub
* <a id="21:03.31">21:03.31 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Oh, I must have missed that third option!
* <a id="21:03.45">21:03.45 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Or he added it later.
* <a id="21:03.59">21:03.59 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: pretty sure it was in the first beta
* <a id="21:04.49">21:04.49 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: maybe it wasn't given as an option to me as I've been exploring his self-hosted option and was logged in that way.
* <a id="21:04.57">21:04.57 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: that seems quite possible
* <a id="21:08.13">21:08.13 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: jeremycherfas did it show up as an option for you?

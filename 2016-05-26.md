The channel is pretty quiet right now, so I thought I'd say hello, and ping some people (like benwerd, mapkyca, and kylewm) that you're here.  If no one responds for a while, try emailing us at hello@openhatch.org or just try coming back later.  FYI, you're now on my list of known nicknames, so I won't bother you again.

* <a id="09:35.48">09:35.48 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Just pushed a new unofficial Known release for those uncomfortable tracking Github. This is everything currently in Git, signed and distributed over HTTPS: mapkyc.me/2HA24xp
* <a id="10:10.13">10:10.13 (BST)</a> - __[Gomez](https://github.com/Gomez)__: mapkyca: Nice, thanks. Will use this to update my installation.
* <a id="12:12.01">12:12.01 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: awesome @mapkyca Will work on a tutorial post for people on how to download and update.
* <a id="15:29.24">15:29.24 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: thanks mapkyca and jgmac1106!
* <a id="16:07.46">16:07.46 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @sensblemn let me check my data caps, running on hotspot now, if I have a bunch I will try and make video today, if not will have to wait until I am home tomorrow
* <a id="20:08.42">20:08.42 (BST)</a> - __[[stefp]](https://github.com/[stefp])__: Are there any big benefits in installing the unofficial release over 0.9.9?
* <a id="20:26.45">20:26.45 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [stefp] yes, especially if you syndicate to silos a bunch me thinks
* <a id="20:36.27">20:36.27 (BST)</a> - __[[stefp]](https://github.com/[stefp])__: Thanks. It’s not really what I want to use Known for but I might update anyway.
* <a id="20:41.31">20:41.31 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [stefp] what is your case? I have so many Known installs going to take me a bit to update them all. Those that are out to pasture may stay at 0.9.2
* <a id="20:47.27">20:47.27 (BST)</a> - __[[stefp]](https://github.com/[stefp])__: I just want to use it for replying to other sites and pulling in Instagram photos. I have the latest official version installed and it seems to be working okay.
* <a id="20:52.37">20:52.37 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: The biggest improvement for me on the latest master is that IG tags now come through correctly. Course, the photos aren’t coming through, but that’s a different problem.
* <a id="21:01.29">21:01.29 (BST)</a> - __[[stefp]](https://github.com/[stefp])__: [jeremycherfas] Thanks. I noticed that any tags in title text are separated and leave the title with the tagged word missing.
* <a id="21:04.56">21:04.56 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Then you need to update
* <a id="21:39.30">21:39.30 (BST)</a> - __[[stefp]](https://github.com/[stefp])__: Just updated. It was easier than I expected.

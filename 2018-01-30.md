* <a id="01:33.55">01:33.55 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: @chrisaldrich after changing the folder name from "video" to "Video" the plugin now seems to work fine.
* <a id="01:35.19">01:35.19 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: my other plugin folder names are "Recipes" and "Reviews" Should they be named differently? Clicking on the enable button doesn't actually enable them.
* <a id="02:04.37">02:04.37 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: They should be called “Recipe” and “Review”

* <a id="03:36.53">03:36.53 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I use other methods to store my videos and photos on IPFS. I would like to post videos and photos on my Known by adding the relevant links instead of having to actually upload with the regular method. The plugins won't let me make a photo or video post without having uploaded a file. Is there an easy way (for noobs) to disable the requirement for the uploads?

* <a id="01:43.54">01:43.54 (GMT)</a> - __[[tantek]](https://github.com/[tantek])__: Definitely filing a GitHub issue
* <a id="01:44.04">01:44.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[tantek]](https://github.com/[tantek])__: I wonder if we can get new Known GitHub issues automatically posted here
* <a id="01:46.45">01:46.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[tantek]](https://github.com/[tantek])__: Ugh RSS right? It's such a bad/lossy format for all this stuff. We really need to just define a one-page h-feed format that includes all comments/responses nested inside every entry
* <a id="01:46.49">01:46.49 (GMT)</a> - __[[tantek]](https://github.com/[tantek])__: RSS--
* <a id="01:46.49">01:46.49 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: rss has -1 karma in this channel (-5 overall)
* <a id="10:39.40">10:39.40 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: for those of you who were avidly following the progress of my Known migration yesterday (that's just Jeremy I think!), I reached out to Reclaim Hosting overnight and they've managed to get me up and running again. Including connecting to my pre-migration database! All I had to do was re-upload any posted images, but there were less than a dozen so that was OK.
* <a id="10:41.28">10:41.28 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: it is a worry though about how flaky Known is, especially as it doesn't seem to be as actively developed as it was at the beginning. Would love to see the export / import made more robust (not an easy task I know!)
* <a id="10:42.29">10:42.29 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: (And none of which is a criticism of the devs btw, who've done an amazing job on what is after all a free product for personal use.)
* <a id="10:48.11">10:48.11 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Good job. Well done.
* <a id="10:48.54">10:48.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Of course, Known will say it is being actively developed, and that's true, but it sometimes seems that the things self-hosters need are not a top priority.
* <a id="10:57.04">10:57.04 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: indeed, and of course we are not the paying customers so that's understandable to an extent
* <a id="11:38.15">11:38.15 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I would be happy to pay.
* <a id="11:41.15">11:41.15 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: I did pay when I first used Known as I used their hosting. Would be happy to do so again.
* <a id="11:42.21">11:42.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I paid a host, before I could do my own SSL, but I doubt that WithKnown ever saw any of that.

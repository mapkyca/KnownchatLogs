* <a id="14:16.07">14:16.07 (BST)</a> - __[ncollig](https://github.com/ncollig)__: Rewriting appears to be disabled. Usually this means "AllowOverride None" is set in apache2.conf which prevents Known's .htaccess from doing its thing. We tried to fetch a URL that should redirect to default.js, but got this response instead:  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently Server: nginx/1.10.0 (Ubuntu) Date: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 12:57:01 GMT Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 194 Connection: keep-alive Location: https://ncoll

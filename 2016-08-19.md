* <a id="19:30.09">19:30.09 (BST)</a> - __[frank__](https://github.com/frank__)__: Hi, I just installed known (0.9.2) and still have a hard time to get the right protocol (->https) generated in the delivered webpages. Can I somehow force the protocol taken for url generating to https? Haven't found such a setting...

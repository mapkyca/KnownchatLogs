* 10:13.10 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: well I finally got my known site back up and stable. got it up a few days ago and was prompted to update thanks to Ben Werd's tweet. well.. while updating I accidentally applied 'chown -R www-data:www-data' to '/var/' rather than '/var/www/' >_<
* 10:13.39 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: since it's an RPi I just reflashed the ubuntu 14.04 image and started again.. /sigh
* 10:55.01 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: endi: ouch! typos while root... we've all been there ;)
* 10:55.49 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: yeah.. that's probably the worst I've ever done
* 10:57.13 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: that is *exactly* the reason I like to do this stuff on an RPi. When I screw these things up I can just reload the clean image :p I guess that's why people are so fond of Virtualization; this level of process isolation while having a lot more horsepower available.
* 11:03.32 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i'm using www.theinternetcu.be for the same reason, it's so easy to flash an image, inject your backup and you're back online with a clean system
* 11:03.59 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: but right now still stuck at messing with nginx so i can find a recipe to make it work with Known on a subdir
* 11:08.54 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: ah cool. It's amazing we've got all these options. Esp. the ARMv7 RPi 2 is mindblowing honestly to run a 50$ (SDCard + PSU) little box with a modern OS, modern kernel
* 11:09.17 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: I messed with my apache2 install until I got all 100's on SSL Labs on a freakin' RaspberryPi lolol
* 11:27.19 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Nicely done :) might be worth posting your apache ssl config for the record... I'm A+, but still not a perfect score on protocol and cipher strength
* 11:38.07 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: yeah, I scaled back
* 11:38.19 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: you can compare the differences:
* 11:38.38 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: 100s: https://social.andrejstefanovski.com/r/SSLLabs_Results_Optimized.jpg
* 11:38.52 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: oops, change that to .pdf to get the report
* 11:39.15 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: scaled back: https://social.andrejstefanovski.com/r/SSLLabs_Results_Production.pdf
* 11:40.43 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: basically to get 100 Protocol, you could only use TLSv1.2; 100 Cipher Strength was only "SSLCipherSuite AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH"
* 11:41.18 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: so, I figured I should probably scale that back to include TLSv1, v1.1 and something lower than 256bit cipher suites.
* 11:41.55 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: The whole point of playing with this stuff for me is to learn about it, so I tweak things.. breaking them 90% of the time but the 10% I learn :)
* 11:51.42 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: yeah: I pretty much gave up trying to support ie as well ;)
* 11:51.46 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=marcus-povey.co.uk
* 12:02.56 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: I was really surprised it support IE8+
* 12:03.26 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: If someone is on pre-IE8 or on WinXP, I'm perfectly fine with not having them as a viewer.
* 12:04.13 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: my site is insignificant to all but a small handful of individuals anyway :)
* 12:04.46 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: and I take care of most of their devices so I know there's no Android <4.4 or Windows <7 or IE <11
* 12:05.44 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: In fact I've almost got all the older generations on Lubuntu skinned like WinXP + Firefox. They haven't got a clue and I can SSH in and take care of updates and issues.
* 12:44.03 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: folks on ie6/8 and XP probably have bigger problems ;) if you have no supported algorithms at least it will fail safe, i.e. they won't be able to connect rather than connect with a weak algo.
* 19:29.39 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: benwerd, I take it you didn't had the time yet to restore my tinokremer.withknown.com and remove the redirect to stream.tinokremer.nl?
* 19:34.26 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: TinoKremer: It apparently didn't take. Sorry about that. You should find that it's up and running now.
* 19:35.32 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: Hehe, no worries. Thanks... I have an odd issue with my selfhosted instance. Brid.gy is nicely adding comments from Facebook and such, but the avatars end up with files of 0 bytes. Not always though, so it's not a rights issue. Did you encounter that before?
* 19:36.25 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: It works now, thanks benwerd !!
* 19:38.25 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: TinoKremer: I haven't seen that before, no. Does anything show up in your error log?
* 19:40.15 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: This looks like a debug message:
* 19:40.15 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: [Thu Aug 06 20:30:18.793878 2015] [:error] [pid 10592] [client 107.178.195.188:56328] Known (stream.tinokremer.nl): DEBUG - Had slug: de-kids-hebben-zich-goed-vermaakt-in-de-tuin 5 [/home/tinokta78/domains/stream.tinokremer.nl/public_html/Idno/Common/Entity.php:447]
* 19:48.40 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: Look at the last comment: https://stream.tinokremer.nl/2015/de-kids-hebben-zich-goed-vermaakt-in-de-tuin#comments
* 19:52.06 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Possible that it's having trouble resampling them - maybe if they're in a non-JPEG format
* 19:52.26 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: These are just facebook profile pics
* 19:52.30 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: I save them as jpg
* 19:53.37 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: It has a normal JFIF header, I actually see PhotoShop 3.0 in the top of the file as well. I wonder if it has to do with my hoster. This is a normal webhosting account and I have seen webserver resets happening while I was working on my site
* 19:53.59 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: For all I know it runs out of memory or something
* 19:56.13 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Oh, that could be true (although I'd expect to see a log entry)
* 19:56.54 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: The only other thing in the logs I do not fully understand is this: [Thu Aug 06 20:48:28.018717 2015] [ssl:warn] [pid 6496] AH01909: www.stream.tinokremer.nl:443:0 server certificate does NOT include an ID which matches the server name

* 19:57.10 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: My cert is for*.tinokremer.nl and not for www.*.tinokremer.nl
* 19:57.18 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: But I do not get who is calling it
* 19:58.45 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: That's not from Known
* 19:59.03 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: Might be related though
* 19:59.06 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: Notice the time

* 20:00.30 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: In fact that is the file that has 0 bytes
* 20:00.38 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: Is there more logging available in Known I can switch on?
* 20:02.42 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: All I can find in the Known (idno) code is removal of www. in front of the hostname. Weird
* 20:32.34 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: I'm going to try without TLS. This webhost uses SNI on their server. Possibly that is causing issues with the CURL library or anywhere else in the process
* 20:38.42 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: TinoKremer: are they 0 bytes actually on disk? 'cos that would imply the library failed to retrieve them. If not, then it's likely a permission / path thing. Cert problems on your end shouldn't stop retrieval of a remote resource, although out of date root certs might.
* 20:39.09 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: They are 0 bytes on disk
* 20:39.15 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: The .data file is there with data in it
* 20:39.21 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: The .file is there with 0 bytes
* 20:40.49 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: hmm
* 20:40.49 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: [Thu Aug 06 21:39:08.047147 2015] [:error] [pid 26081] [client 107.178.195.188:38562] Known (stream.tinokremer.nl): ERROR - Could not find handler for http://stream.tinokremer.nl/10101859667632951/test 5
* 20:46.38 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: so .data is the file's metadata, and .file is the actual file binary, so that implies that it was retrieval/save that went wrong. Avatars are retrieved when the webmention ping is received (to prevent various problems, not least some tracking/hacking exploits), so there's every possibility that this had an intermittent failure. I'd expect to see something logged mind, but that might be a separate issue.
* 20:51.34 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: This error above is because brid.gy caches webmention endpoints. It says so in the log and it goes to https while it should not. So that should solve itself when the cache expires. I'm out of things to try.... It's almost 10pm here, I'll drop it for now and give it some more thought
* 20:52.23 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: You could have some luck bypassing bridgy and manually running the webmention
* 20:52.48 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: so look in the bridgy logs for the urls in question (modify as necessary) and then fire the webmention using curl
* 20:53.23 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: e.g. curl -i -d "source=<source>&target=<target>" <your webmention endpoint>
* 20:53.50 (BST) - __[TinoKremer](https://github.com/TinoKremer)__: ty.. Will try that
* 20:54.10 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: if that works then it's a bridgy thing, and might be worth nudging @snarfed over on #indiewebcamp
* 23:02.49 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benwerd: assets link to known repo is not delivered over https, plus no signed signature. Should probably change that...
* 23:03.22 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Yeah, it's an S3 bucket. I'll look into adding the certificate.
* 23:06.52 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: fair doos... any reason not to use pegged "releases" on github?
* 23:07.40 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (not that that'll solve the signing)
* 23:07.49 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: A little more control. We do also have those.
* 23:16.02 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: time for sleeps, methinks. goodnight t'interwebs :)

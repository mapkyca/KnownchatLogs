* <a id="16:04.03">16:04.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I really want to try and work out why Known no longer displays images from ownyourgram since the most recent update about two weeks ago.
* <a id="16:04.55">16:04.55 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So I suppose rolling back the changes in `Photo.tpl.php` is the place to start.
* <a id="16:21.35">16:21.35 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: That didn't help; just took me back to content being Array and still no image. So I might have broken something else, I suppose.
* <a id="16:25.02">16:25.02 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: This is really odd. Something is adding files that I simply do not recognise to my WithKnown Uploads folder.
* <a id="16:27.29">16:27.29 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Ah, no. They are the avatars of Webmentions coming in from brid.gy
* <a id="16:27.40">16:27.40 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: more likely to be the multi picture upload changes added to the micropub endpoint, but I don't have a public instagram so can't check right now
* <a id="16:28.35">16:28.35 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Give me a clue where to look!
* <a id="16:30.57">16:30.57 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Do you mean 9b0d62906cd6bb1f4a97c3d1e537bf03a33d896c
* <a id="16:31.06">16:31.06 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: mapkyca: you can test uploading photos via quill
* <a id="16:31.12">16:31.12 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: or micropub.rocks
* <a id="16:31.32">16:31.32 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Quill has never worked for me, but I am happy to try again.
* <a id="16:31.59">16:31.59 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Using Editor, right?
* <a id="16:32.07">16:32.07 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: no, note interface
* <a id="16:32.15">16:32.15 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: you can attach one or more photos there
* <a id="16:32.24">16:32.24 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: micropub.rocks might be a better test tho, easier to reproduce specific cases
* <a id="16:35.29">16:35.29 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Nope; picture fails to show. Let me look at Quill log.
* <a id="16:40.02">16:40.02 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Does Quill identify itself in error logs? I can't find it by name.
* <a id="16:43.15">16:43.15 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I see this in access log 173.230.155.197 - - [05/Jun/2018:08:34:36 -0700] "POST /micropub/endpoint HTTP/1.1" 201 4317 "-" "-"
* <a id="16:43.26">16:43.26 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And nothing in error log that makes sense.
* <a id="16:46.28">16:46.28 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: that looks like quill's IP. guess it doesn't set a user agent
* <a id="16:48.11">16:48.11 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Np. Back to basics. Tried to upload a post direct to Known from the interface; get an error. Fatal Error: /home/jeremygrav/stream.jeremycherfas.net/Idno/Entities/File.php:203 - "Allowed memory size of 94371840 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 12288 bytes)"
* <a id="16:48.42">16:48.42 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Will try with a smaller file first
* <a id="16:51.15">16:51.15 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Smaller file works with no title or description.
* <a id="16:53.03">16:53.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Works with title and description too. Now let me try Quill with a smaller photo (although none of this explains why Known was displaying images from OYG before and then stopped)
* <a id="16:54.54">16:54.54 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Quill is unable to post a photo for me. The content comes in as a title and the tag comes in, but not the image itself.
* <a id="17:16.37">17:16.37 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So many moving parts, so much frustration
* <a id="17:32.25">17:32.25 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: !tell mapkyca I really appreciate the tags displaying properly but I cannot for the life of me find the problem with displaying photos from OYG or Quill. Any clues you can offer gratefully received.
* <a id="17:32.25">17:32.25 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="17:43.10">17:43.10 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I think the issue is something to do with create media, but more than that I cannot figure out.

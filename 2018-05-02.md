* <a id="12:32.04">12:32.04 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I've just noticed that when I am asked to sign in to Known again, I get a website insecure notice. That's odd, as my whole site is under HTTPS.
* <a id="12:43.54">12:43.54 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [jeremycherfas] its http/https mixed content. You would need to go through and find any images and links with http
* <a id="12:44.22">12:44.22 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I don't know an easy fix for Known,, in Wordpress I use a few find and replace plug ins
* <a id="12:52.10">12:52.10 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Are you seeing the same in Known? I've not seen it before. What I really ought to do is give my login a longer life.
* <a id="13:20.45">13:20.45 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Yes. [jeremycherfas] it is the browser not the site. Both FF and Chrome will give warning when sites encounter mixed http/https plug-ins. Go on Twiter and ask Dave Winer about it. Its fun to watch him get all worked up
* <a id="13:21.07">13:21.07 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I see it in Wordpress too but that is an easy fix involving two plug ins
* <a id="13:22.11">13:22.11 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I've never seen it in Safari before, and that's where I saw it this morning. Can't be arsed to shoot fish in a barrel.

* <a id="13:49.28">13:49.28 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: That's a tutorial from ShowMe but it may work. Is it a multiuser site install or you only person signing on?
* <a id="13:50.42">13:50.42 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I haven't figured out a way to search for all http and replace with https on every link and image yet for Known
* <a id="14:39.45">14:39.45 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: You can do the link without a protocol trick
* <a id="14:42.59">14:42.59 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [kevinmarks] is there an easy way to find replace in a  MySQL database
* <a id="14:46.17">14:46.17 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: Not that I can think of.
* <a id="14:49.39">14:49.39 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Would webmentions break if a reply gets changed to https but the source remains http?
* <a id="14:55.19">14:55.19 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: It would if they were resent

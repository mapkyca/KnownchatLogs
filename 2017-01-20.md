* <a id="14:45.52">14:45.52 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Hi, is there any way to import RSS into Known? It would be useful for quantified self stuff.
* <a id="15:41.27">15:41.27 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: @jaduncan[m] there's a wordpress import, is that what you're looking for?
* <a id="15:48.22">15:48.22 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: No, more a live import. So I have a datasource that issues an RSS entry, followed by Known picking up on the new RSS entry and importing it. That way I can have a post tag for, say, bike rides automatically exported and then onto my site.
* <a id="15:48.54">15:48.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Essentially RSS import on a cron job/poll.
* <a id="16:06.19">16:06.19 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: No, nothing like that in core. Could be done in a plugin to accept an RSS dump to an endpoint and parse it.
* <a id="16:06.47">16:06.47 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: or if you're not wedded to rss, you could do a ping directly through the api
* <a id="16:37.05">16:37.05 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Yeah. I'm discussing the possibility of doing it through micropub with the indieweb guys; an RSS to micropub converter would be handy for lots of QS stuff, IFTTT and PESOS in general. The API is interesting, but it would mean lots of adaptation for different sources when there's a sort of rough and ready output message that's used by a lot of people. I don't know if it's something you guys would be interested in having
* <a id="16:37.06">16:37.06 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: via plugin or if I should do it with the external solution. So in your API suggestion I'd be getting things directly from the datasource API?

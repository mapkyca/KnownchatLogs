* <a id="11:07.46">11:07.46 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’ve wondered the same. I made a tiny step in that direction by adding an RSS stream of my Known posts to my main site. Need to do more in that direction.

This requires a rather nasty (imo) hack to get it to work with textarea and form posting (which is not natively supported), so I'd appreciate it if folk could kick the tires on it before it gets merged...

Spent the wee hours setting up my nephews with blogs using @withknown and adding them to our private family social network: https://ourclan.jgregorymcverry.com/. Excited to eventually add a family ...  https://is.gd/VsjGIh (http://twtr.io/1faW2R4oxjY)
* <a id="12:49.00">12:49.00 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Hi, is there a demo instance of Known that I can use to play with and check it out?
* <a id="13:02.41">13:02.41 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @nw[m] here you go: https://knowndemo.jgregorymcverry.com/ It is a 0.9.2 (current is 0.9.9) but if you join I will make you an admin so you can play
* <a id="13:02.53">13:02.53 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Greg McVerry
* <a id="13:03.19">13:03.19 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: will update to 0.9.9.9 later, trying to get a few work hours in before I take kids to beach
* <a id="13:05.04">13:05.04 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: [jgmac1106]: Thanks! Will check it out
* <a id="13:06.47">13:06.47 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Registered as nils
* <a id="13:08.12">13:08.12 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: So, if I understand correctly, Known is basically an alternative to WordPress with fewer plugins?
* <a id="13:08.14">13:08.14 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: And more indieweb features?
* <a id="13:11.33">13:11.33 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: What is Known?
* <a id="13:12.29">13:12.29 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: https://indieweb.org/Known
* <a id="13:13.36">13:13.36 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: but yes it is a lightweight CMS with turnkey native indieweb support, whereas WordPress is the constant tinkering of themes and plugins to make Indieweb work, known just works out of the box.
* <a id="13:15.05">13:15.05 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com https://clmooc.jgregorymcvery.com, https://rhizo15.jgregorymcverry.com/ are all different versions I have a bazillion Known sites
* <a id="13:15.36">13:15.36 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: http://clmooc.jgregorymcverry.com/ oops
* <a id="13:16.17">13:16.17 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Sounds good!
* <a id="13:53.20">13:53.20 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @nw[m] you are now an admin feel free to mess around
* <a id="13:59.43">13:59.43 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: again though this is an old version. i will push to 0.9.9 after I take kids to beach
* <a id="14:00.32">14:00.32 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Any thoughts on how Known compares to Grav?
* <a id="14:02.05">14:02.05 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Never played with grav, there are grav users here, but Known is meant for non technical end users, grav may take more DIY
* <a id="14:06.32">14:06.32 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: üëåüèª
* <a id="14:36.28">14:36.28 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Thanks, [jgmac1106]  -- how do I delete my account? I'm done playing :)
* <a id="14:39.23">14:39.23 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I will delete it
* <a id="14:41.02">14:41.02 (BST)</a> - __[nw[m]](https://github.com/nw[m])__: Cheers
* <a id="14:51.31">14:51.31 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Grav, Ruby, Drupal  the more technical but actively developed CMS, WordPress biggest portion of community...but its WordPress, the more technical crowd used Jekyll or some home built CMS or SSG

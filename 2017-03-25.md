* <a id="18:52.11">18:52.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: !tell dgold, jeremycherfas, I'm actually thinking that bridgy backfeed for pnut is a convoluted (and possibly unnecessary idea), it's probably far easier and simpler for them to add /webmention support directly! Then one could interact with pnut community from one's own site and get notifications back directly!
* <a id="18:53.22">18:53.22 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: If pnut did this, they could also (potentially?) be the first network to actively support webmentions en masse. (Presuming they beat manton's micro.blog effort.)
* <a id="18:53.24">18:53.24 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I'd life to think that would be true, [chrisaldrich].
* <a id="18:53.30">18:53.30 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: *like
* <a id="18:54.26">18:54.26 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: at the moment, they're just trying to reach feature-equivalence with what was ADN
* <a id="18:54.38">18:54.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: From a programming, support, and infrastructure perspective, it would certainly be easier.
* <a id="18:54.57">18:54.57 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: well "they" == one guy
* <a id="18:55.27">18:55.27 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Bridgy really exists for social /silos that won't support webmention (and this is typically for monetary reasons to maintain their walled garden)
* <a id="18:56.50">18:56.50 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold do you know him well? It would certainly be worth a conversation.
* <a id="18:58.46">18:58.46 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I imagine that pnut could spend less than a day to add microformats2 support and then a day or two at most to add basic webmention support.
* <a id="18:59.54">18:59.54 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: microformats support is something I can ask him about, sure
* <a id="19:00.05">19:00.05 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I think he'd probably be ery open to that
* <a id="19:00.23">19:00.23 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: It would also be awesome if they supported micropub, then it could potentially be much easier to support a richer category of multi-platform apps to publish into the system.
* <a id="21:48.43">21:48.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: !tell chrisaldrich, dgold I expect you're right and that Robert would be open to the idea. Does it go far beyond adding some formatting for mf2? I'm sure that would be relatively easy. Webmention might be more difficult because every user would need to be involved. Or have I got that wrong?
* <a id="21:48.43">21:48.43 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="22:03.41">22:03.41 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: jeremycherfas, he'd need to add mf2 and some additional code specific to webmentions. It would affect all the users, though he could provide a toggle to turn off webmentions for specific users if they don't want it.

* <a id="11:42.47">11:42.47 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: hey sensiblemn Yeah, I know the github repo. But there it also says:
* <a id="11:42.48">11:42.48 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: > If you are installing Known for use on your own website, we HIGHLY recommend using the installable packages from https://withknown.com/opensource. Installation will be much easier!
* <a id="11:43.07">11:43.07 (GMT)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: So I was waiting for a new confirmed and tested point release
* <a id="11:44.26">11:44.26 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: that makes sense. i'd send an email to the Known email list with this question if I were you.

Kevin Marks asked me to check it was coming via webmention or direct via comment form; it is the latter. I don't really need comments enabled on my Known site; is there any way to disable them? Thanks

* <a id="19:46.07">19:46.07 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: The plugin is "Public Comments"
* <a id="19:47.35">19:47.35 (BST)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Aha, I looked for a plugin called "Comments" but didn't scroll past when I saw there wasn't one. Found it and disabled now, many thanks :)

Maybe he'll start coming to Social Web Community Group meetings @dustyweb @aaronpk .  Or buy out nextcloud @fkarlitschek.  Or withknown @benwerd.  Uh huh. https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571 (http://twtr.io/1_tvdVY5ZeC)
* <a id="15:54.24">15:54.24 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: By looking at other peoples Known sites I have a good idea of it's abilities. How does following work on known? Is it RSS based? Do we need a seperate feed reader?
* <a id="15:54.54">15:54.54 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: I'd like to try it out before trying to install but I can't find any public demo.
* <a id="15:57.30">15:57.30 (GMT)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: camb: you need a seperate reader
* <a id="15:57.52">15:57.52 (GMT)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: known just gives you the feed(s) for your site and content, but in order to subscribe you need a reader app
* <a id="15:58.11">15:58.11 (GMT)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: either RSS reader, or indieweb reader

* <a id="16:01.50">16:01.50 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: thanks @raucao I've been looking into different feed readers already. I thought Known had some privacy options (like share only with friends). I must have understood wrong. How could one create a closed group, since rss has no privacy options?
* <a id="16:02.06">16:02.06 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: !tell cambs There is a community Known blog; I'm just seearching for the link. But maybe someone else remembers it.
* <a id="16:02.13">16:02.13 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: Is Known "public only"?

* <a id="16:10.17">16:10.17 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: @jeremycherfas Awesome! signing up
* <a id="16:10.36">16:10.36 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Good luck. Hasn't seen a whole lot of activity, I must say.
* <a id="16:10.50">16:10.50 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I run Known myself, so if you have specific questions I may be able to help.
* <a id="16:15.05">16:15.05 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: The commenting and stars now work only with posts from known.cloud. How do we comment and like posts on other sites?
* <a id="16:17.36">16:17.36 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: If you click on the button to write a new status, below the input field you can select “Reply to a site”.

* <a id="16:18.50">16:18.50 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: @Zegnat Awesome. And the stars?
* <a id="16:20.29">16:20.29 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: I am not sure what the “star” would be as a post type. You can bookmark external sites, which can result in the other site showing the feedback on their end. But I am surprised there isn’t a “like” post type.
* <a id="16:21.02">16:21.02 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: I can’t say if Known.Cloud is showing all of Knowns features though. I haven’t had it installed myself for a while now.
* <a id="16:23.37">16:23.37 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Bookmarks now include likes. I think.
* <a id="16:24.43">16:24.43 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: Yes.bookmarking leaves a webmention. From testing this site here I can see that the bookmark left a "mentioned in" on the original post. No like though. https://s.ly/2015/kickstarter

* <a id="16:37.23">16:37.23 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: maybe it's outdated ? I just tried the "like" option in the Wordpress indieweb plugin, but that doesn't seem to have registered the like either.
* <a id="16:41.48">16:41.48 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: Other than that It looks to be a very nice interface. Maybe this is the one that can help win over some friends. :)
* <a id="16:49.59">16:49.59 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: I use matrix/riot for the #indieweb channel. Just thought I'd mention that the #known channel isn't properly updating on matrix. #freenode_#known:matrix.org
* <a id="16:50.44">16:50.44 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Right now, the biggest hurdle is the Known requires you to be able to install it on a server yourself. There's currently no more paid hosting, expect possible at indiehosters.org
* <a id="16:53.39">16:53.39 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: I can install it. And I will probably allow others to register too. I just needed a quick look behind the scenes :) I like it. It looks much easier than expecting average users to use Wrodpress + Indie plugins.
* <a id="16:54.38">16:54.38 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: I'm trying to create a simple "interface" with decentralized FOSS tech at https://odat.xyz
* <a id="16:55.19">16:55.19 (GMT)</a> - __[camb](https://github.com/camb)__: I like that kown relies on RSS. I loved RSS years ago. Forgot about it for a while, and when I came back it was almost dead :/
* <a id="17:36.26">17:36.26 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: The death of RSS has been reported far too often to be believable.

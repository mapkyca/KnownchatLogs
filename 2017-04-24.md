* <a id="09:46.26">09:46.26 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: morning all
* <a id="09:46.28">09:46.28 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: mapkyca: [cleverdevil] left you a message 1 week, 2 days ago: OK, ticket filed - https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1702
* <a id="17:24.42">17:24.42 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Morning, folks.
* <a id="17:29.55">17:29.55 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: bonjour :)
* <a id="17:33.12">17:33.12 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, I've noticed that the "Select a Photo" button on Media posts no longer allows me to actually select photos on iOS.
* <a id="17:33.20">17:33.20 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: (This is on latest master).
* <a id="17:33.36">17:33.36 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It just brings up the camera with no ability to pick a photo from my library.
* <a id="17:35.09">17:35.09 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Oh, I mean on Photo, not Media.
* <a id="17:35.34">17:35.34 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: wow mapkyca you're on a roll! https://github.com/idno/Known/commits/master
* <a id="17:35.59">17:35.59 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yup, thanks mapkyca! Merging all the things.
* <a id="17:36.42">17:36.42 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: that's strange. I wasn't aware there was a way to trigger the camera directly. I thought it always brought up the little action sheet
* <a id="17:37.15">17:37.15 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: This is the markup that's used in the Photo plugin: http://share.cleverdevil.io/ZYLiDl7Zsy.png
* <a id="17:37.40">17:37.40 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: This is what is used in another plugin where it still allows me to pick a photo from my library: http://share.cleverdevil.io/Fhuq9All5o.png
* <a id="17:38.17">17:38.17 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I am thinking it *may* be the `accept="image/*;capture=camera"` line that works
* <a id="17:38.27">17:38.27 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i never knew about capture="camera"
* <a id="17:38.40">17:38.40 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: And the `accept="image/*" capture="camera"` that doesn't.
* <a id="17:38.43">17:38.43 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Trying it out...
* <a id="17:38.54">17:38.54 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: i'm guessing iOS ignored the "capture=camera" bit inside "accept"
* <a id="17:39.05">17:39.05 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: but now that it's an attribute, it recognizes it
* <a id="17:39.14">17:39.14 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: yeah, could be.
* <a id="17:40.07">17:40.07 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yup, confirmed, that fixes it.
* <a id="17:48.11">17:48.11 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1725
* <a id="17:48.15">17:48.15 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Ticket created.
* <a id="17:48.39">17:48.39 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'd like to wrap up my "<" and ">" pull request before I move on to something else, but I'll try and get to it.
* <a id="17:48.50">17:48.50 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its an easy fix, so anyone else should feel free to steal my thunder and fix it themselves ðŸ˜‰
* <a id="18:29.07">18:29.07 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: thanks aaronpk! ... had some Known time today :)
* <a id="18:37.52">18:37.52 (BST)</a> - __[martymcguire[m]](https://github.com/martymcguire[m])__: mapkyca++ thanks for all the merging!

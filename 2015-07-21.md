* 06:04.59 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: bah. much sadness. my Known server (RPi) won't be coming back online :(
* 06:06.22 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: spent the last 4 days messing with fsck to get the ext4 partition repaired. have access to /var/www as well as mysql's /home/knowndata but I have no clue *if* I can recreate the database on a fresh install
* 09:32.20 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: endi: sorry for your loss! If you've managed to restore the mysql database (and it isn't entirely corrupted) you should be able to recover your site
* 10:56.29 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: @mapkyca Setting up the Known site was my first experience w/ MySQL so I will have to look into how I'd try to restore the db
* 10:57.42 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: looks like whatever borked my SD card corrupted some folder in /var/lib/
* 10:59.54 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: I purged mysql-server, reinstalled but initial config keeps failing and I ran out of steam for the evening. I will look into the location of the db and see if anything salvageable; all I know I have access to are the directory mysql was saving to and those files are readable
* 11:00.38 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: tl;dr - I'm a mysql noob so we'll see :)
* 11:39.50 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: endi: (who has now left, but I'll write here for the logs) if you have access to the .MYD & .MYI files in, and those aren't corrupted, you should be able to restore stuff (with a bit of massaging with mysql repair functions in places).
* 11:41.10 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Personally, I'm starting to think there might be a case for a sqlite db engine for folk who are trying to run sites on Pis etc as it may have a smaller footprint / easier backup since it's just a flat file
* 11:41.31 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: ... might have a hack when I've got a spare hour or so

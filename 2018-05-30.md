* <a id="13:58.35">13:58.35 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: [jgmac1106] What's your build? There was a long time bug (which exists in the "official" release) that caused the invalid token to appear for some people
* <a id="15:52.04">15:52.04 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I had updated to 9.9 on that one not to GitHub, I will update to your new build
* <a id="15:52.56">15:52.56 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I need to make sure that a 9.2 build can handle going to your new master but haven't got around to checking, It failed last time I tried but I think I lost my config.ini file. Will try again on https://bookmarks.jgregorymcverry.com
* <a id="15:53.25">15:53.25 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Most people I know will be updating from 92 as that is when Installation gave out on them for ReClaim
* <a id="15:54.06">15:54.06 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: but the token error makes sense if that was a problem in official build. Willupdate to Master on lunch break. Too much indieweb time to break out the Pomodor timer to stay on point
* <a id="16:25.19">16:25.19 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: If you do upgrade to latest github master [jgmac1106] and you use ownyourgram I would be interested to know whether your images come back to your site.
* <a id="16:26.05">16:26.05 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @jermycherfas I don't instagram, I need to set up ownyourgram as a POC for friends and fam somaybe I will try

* <a id="13:33.46">13:33.46 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca_](https://github.com/mapkyca_)__: !tell [cleverdevil] Very nice! Any plans to release it as a plugin?
* <a id="13:33.47">13:33.47 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="14:48.58">14:48.58 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: hello!  I know Known supports multiple users in one install, but can Known support each user's content being accessed at a distinct domain name?
* <a id="14:49.36">14:49.36 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: such that Known user1's content is at foobar.com and user2's contnet is at quux.net, using the same install of Known?
* <a id="14:57.43">14:57.43 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Same install, yes, but they'd be in separate databases. You want to take a look at multitenant mode. This lets you have different sites all running off the same install, but potentially with different configurations.
* <a id="14:57.52">14:57.52 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/config/#other-configini-directives
* <a id="14:58.02">14:58.02 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (not massively well documented)
* <a id="14:58.51">14:58.51 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: This may not be *quite* what you're after, essentially they're different sites but using the same install. Users can webmention each other etc
* <a id="14:59.46">14:59.46 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: similar to a WordPress multi-site setup, then?  thats fine.
* <a id="15:00.59">15:00.59 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: thank you
* <a id="15:04.20">15:04.20 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: can one enable and disable specific content types?  Say I dont ever plan to use RSVPs, can I suppress that as an option to create or display?
* <a id="15:04.46">15:04.46 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: also, can i choose which types of replies to display? Say I dont want likes showing up?
* <a id="19:16.26">19:16.26 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: how do i turn off the "2 min read" line on posts?
* <a id="21:41.18">21:41.18 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Good afternoon ðŸ™‚
* <a id="21:41.18">21:41.18 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: !tell @mapkyca https://github.com/cleverdevil/PhotoIndex
* <a id="21:41.19">21:41.19 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [cleverdevil] PhotoIndex: Plugin for Known that creates an Instagram-inspired photo index page on your website.
* <a id="21:41.21">21:41.21 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Anyone who wants to have a Photo Index page like mine - https://github.com/cleverdevil/PhotoIndex

* <a id="21:50.27">21:50.27 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: [cleverdevil]: how do you suppress the estimated reading length of Known posts?  Are you using a custom theme?
* <a id="21:51.32">21:51.32 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: oh, you're not suppressing them from notes.  just that recipe and photos.
* <a id="21:54.06">21:54.06 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I don't know if you can disable that.
* <a id="21:54.11">21:54.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I mean, you can with some code.
* <a id="21:54.20">21:54.20 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: But, I don't think its something that's doable without code.
* <a id="21:54.23">21:54.23 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Let me check...
* <a id="21:54.42">21:54.42 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: its not in the settings anywhere.
* <a id="21:55.30">21:55.30 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You could do it with custom CSS super easily.
* <a id="21:55.46">21:55.46 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: and i dont think i have the fortitude to deal with devising a custom theme at this time.
* <a id="21:55.57">21:55.57 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You can do custom CSS without a custom theme.
* <a id="21:55.59">21:55.59 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: I loathe the idea of hiding things with CSS.
* <a id="21:56.01">21:56.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its there in the settings.
* <a id="21:56.03">21:56.03 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: ðŸ™‚
* <a id="21:56.09">21:56.09 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: but thats me being super fussy.
* <a id="21:56.19">21:56.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Fair enough, but looking at the code, that's the only way to do it without writing code.
* <a id="21:56.27">21:56.27 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: thanks for checking!
* <a id="21:57.07">21:57.07 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Wait... one more place to check.
* <a id="21:57.19">21:57.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Looks like there is a setting on an Entity to tell it to suppress this.
* <a id="21:57.30">21:57.30 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: But, I am not sure if its something that you can set in the settings.
* <a id="21:57.47">21:57.47 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Nope. You can't.
* <a id="21:58.17">21:58.17 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its either custom CSS to hide it, custom JavaScript to literally remove it from the DOM, or a plugin that you'd have to write.
* <a id="21:59.47">21:59.47 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: thanks for looking.  i'm not even sure why I dislike that so much.
* <a id="22:02.27">22:02.27 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: how is known's admin interface on mobile?
* <a id="22:03.04">22:03.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its... fine.
* <a id="22:03.17">22:03.17 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I wouldn't call it perfect, but it tries to be responsive and mostly is ðŸ™‚
* <a id="22:03.45">22:03.45 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: fair enough. thanks.
* <a id="22:13.25">22:13.25 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: can plugins easily provide supoprt for new permalink structures?  I prefer /:slug, with no dates in my URLs, if possible.
* <a id="22:15.31">22:15.31 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: No idea.
* <a id="22:15.35">22:15.35 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: okie dokie.
* <a id="22:16.18">22:16.18 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Looks like you can do it purely in the configuration file.
* <a id="22:16.35">22:16.35 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: The setting is `permalink_structure`
* <a id="22:17.08">22:17.08 (GMT)</a> - __[skippy](https://github.com/skippy)__: ah.  the docs are lacking there.
* <a id="22:17.36">22:17.36 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Indeed

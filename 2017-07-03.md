* <a id="10:08.24">10:08.24 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Notifications has been repeatedly asked for, and a feed on comments would also be useful. I'll see if I can get to it at some point...
* <a id="12:25.38">12:25.38 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: raucao: Put together a little pull request which brings back notifications, and among other things, adds an RSS feed to notification items :) ... will hold off on merging until I confer with ben and kyle, since notifications were removed for "UI reasons", but I'm not sure what those were, other than the read/unread class names being wrong. Meanwhile, feel free to kick the tires :)

Still needs a lot of work, and I think Ben and Erin want to explore different ways of representing this data, but since we're mid release it seems sensible to have some existing code to work with...

* <a id="17:02.50">17:02.50 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: the theming / cosmetic questions / issues are worthy of consideration
* <a id="17:03.15">17:03.15 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: makes me wonder if every such system should have a generic "stream page" theme that can be applied to any new 'stream-like' page
* <a id="17:03.38">17:03.38 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, Known has that, really.
* <a id="17:03.50">17:03.50 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: But, notifications are a bit different than standard streams.
* <a id="17:03.55">17:03.55 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: e.g. anything where otherwise you might say "just look at it in a reader" implies that a theme could have such a "reader stream" template in the theme that could be applied to any new h-feed page
* <a id="17:03.58">17:03.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Different type of data being represented.
* <a id="17:04.02">17:04.02 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: how?
* <a id="17:04.14">17:04.14 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Well, I suppose it isn't *that* different.
* <a id="17:04.18">17:04.18 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: can you point to screenshots of examples that show such differences?
* <a id="17:04.27">17:04.27 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Actually, now that I think about it, its really not that different...
* <a id="17:04.53">17:04.53 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: [cleverdevil]: the point is, if someone could say "I just want to see it in a reader" - implies that they don't care for its presentation to be any different than a generic stream
* <a id="17:05.07">17:05.07 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: so no need to make it more complicated
* <a id="17:05.58">17:05.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, point taken.
* <a id="17:06.29">17:06.29 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'd have to look in more detail, but I definitely think that the current notifications page in Known could potentially be re-envisioned as an alternate "stream" type view.
* <a id="17:06.55">17:06.55 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: this is why I think any such "theme" should include a generic "stream page" template
* <a id="17:07.10">17:07.10 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: so any new feature that shows more than one "item" could default to using that template
* <a id="17:07.19">17:07.19 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: so it at least would look "ok" / good enough to ship
* <a id="17:07.54">17:07.54 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: then later, as a separate incremental step, if someone feels like it deserves more custom treatment, they could create a custom template for it. but keeping that as a second strictly optional step would help with more rapidly deploying new stream-like features.

* <a id="14:39.06">14:39.06 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Trying to do an installation from the latest master source, but it threw an error after the MySQL settings. Any known problems with current master code for installation? Or might it be my setup?
* <a id="15:09.41">15:09.41 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Ah, it is my setup. It is apparently mistakenly identifying Known as sitting in a subdir
* <a id="15:26.24">15:26.24 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Odd.
* <a id="15:31.02">15:31.02 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Also found out why. I was using valet to serve Known, and the way valet handles the URL rewriting leaves PHP_SELF in a format not compatible with Known’s subdir support.
* <a id="15:45.45">15:45.45 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Glad you sorted it out. Beyond me. I'm currently working on something else entirely.
* <a id="19:53.30">19:53.30 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: After entering mysql and the upload directory during the Known installation the web-UI is giving me this error. We can't write data to /var/www/html/known.odat.xyz/Uploads/ - please check permissions and try again.
* <a id="19:53.50">19:53.50 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: What permissions am I supposed to check here?
* <a id="20:00.06">20:00.06 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: The folder permissions on the server, whether the uploads folder is writable
* <a id="20:03.19">20:03.19 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: I’ll depend on how you access the server, how you would do that. Shell access / FTP client / etc.
* <a id="20:30.25">20:30.25 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: thank you @zegnat
* <a id="20:30.52">20:30.52 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Been able to fix it? :)
* <a id="20:31.13">20:31.13 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: not yet.
* <a id="20:40.17">20:40.17 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Dropping this here in case anyone else is using valet for their local PHP environment. The BasicValetDriver doesn’t work for Known, but this should: https://gist.github.com/Zegnat/062adb3e1f0ed935035f0e4fd4c36ecd
* <a id="20:44.58">20:44.58 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I got it.
* <a id="20:48.20">20:48.20 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Where can I find the admin interface? It doesn't look like an admin account was created during the installation.
* <a id="20:52.22">20:52.22 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Ah got it. mysite.com/admin
* <a id="20:52.49">20:52.49 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Is the first account created the admin account then?
* <a id="21:23.26">21:23.26 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Should be, yes
* <a id="21:26.34">21:26.34 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: regarding new user registration, are there any options to add captcha and/or email verification?
* <a id="21:29.06">21:29.06 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: That I do not know. Haven’t played with open registration yet.
* <a id="21:40.11">21:40.11 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I see the Known website doesn't have automated open registration either.
* <a id="21:53.54">21:53.54 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I copied the video plugin to my plugin directory. It then showed up in my admin panel and I enabled it. However I'm not seing the option to post or filter videos now. do I have to do anything else?
* <a id="22:20.30">22:20.30 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: https://github.com/cweiske/withknownVideo
* <a id="22:20.31">22:20.31 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [cweiske] withknownVideo: Simple video plugin for Known
* <a id="22:32.23">22:32.23 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Same problem with the Review and Recipe plugins.
* <a id="22:33.01">22:33.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, I wrote the last two.
* <a id="22:33.01">22:33.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You have them installed, but they're not showing up once you're logged in?
* <a id="22:35.43">22:35.43 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: yes @cleverdevil . They are not showing up as a post option or filter option.
* <a id="22:36.22">22:36.22 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: And you're sure you've activated them in Known?
* <a id="22:37.49">22:37.49 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: The default plugins did show up after I enabled them. (Like: audio, location, etc)
* <a id="22:39.02">22:39.02 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Ah. when I click on enable they are not actually enabled.
* <a id="22:40.16">22:40.16 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Interesting.
* <a id="22:40.24">22:40.24 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That was my suspicion.
* <a id="22:40.32">22:40.32 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Is this the latest Known from git?
* <a id="22:40.38">22:40.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Or a release?
* <a id="22:40.54">22:40.54 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I downloaded the package today.
* <a id="22:41.23">22:41.23 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: from https://withknown.com/opensource/
* <a id="22:43.01">22:43.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Strange that enabling a plugin doesn't work for you.
* <a id="22:43.20">22:43.20 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You said that enabling the core plugins seemed to work, so I am wondering if there is an on-disk issue, like permissions or something.
* <a id="22:43.46">22:43.46 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Make sure that all of the files in IdnoPlugins have the appropriate (and same) permissions and owners.
* <a id="22:43.48">22:43.48 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: The other plugins enabled just fine. and so did the video plugin (also it doesnt show anything)
* <a id="22:48.27">22:48.27 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: sudo chown -R www-data /var/www/ -> chmod -R 755 /var/www/
* <a id="22:48.55">22:48.55 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: did that just to make sure. but no changes as far as I can tell
* <a id="22:50.15">22:50.15 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: I get the message "plugin enabled" on the top of the page. But the plugin isn't marked as enabled.
* <a id="22:52.21">22:52.21 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: During my installation the Web UI showed that all requirements were satisfied.
* <a id="22:52.50">22:52.50 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So strange.
* <a id="22:52.55">22:52.55 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You're not having any other odd behavior?
* <a id="22:52.58">22:52.58 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You can create posts, etc.?
* <a id="22:56.20">22:56.20 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: yes. I can create posts. Other stuff seems to work fine. What error log should I be looking into?
* <a id="22:57.43">22:57.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Depends. But I’d check the Apache and PHP logs usually found in /var/log
* <a id="23:15.05">23:15.05 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: In my apache error log I'm only seeing something about the video plugin.
* <a id="23:15.19">23:15.19 (GMT)</a> - __[CamB](https://github.com/CamB)__: Known (known.odat.xyz): error - Could not add /video/edit/([A-Za-z0-9]+)/?. \IdnoPlugins\Video\Pages\Edit not found, referer: http://known.odat.xyz/admin/plugins/

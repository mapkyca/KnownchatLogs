* <a id="12:02.15">12:02.15 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/jaduncan">@jaduncan</a>] @edrex @lehudgins Oh man. How did you get a withknown invite? I'd kill for one. (http://twtr.io/1NAxfL2PwsN)
* <a id="12:04.21">12:04.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Eh heh, and my Twitter post bounces here. If there's anyone who is able to hook me up without an actual assassination being required, that would also be good.
* <a id="12:17.33">12:17.33 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Jaduncan Do you actually need an invite?
* <a id="12:22.10">12:22.10 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I guess you donâ€™t want to host yourself.
* <a id="13:39.32">13:39.32 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: An invite would be very good, because I'm about to cycle down Africa and won't have time for sysadminning. Nowhere else does absolutely fully managed hosting.
* <a id="13:41.16">13:41.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: jeremycherfas: Basically, I'm hoping to use Known to blog it all, but don't want to find out that I've been hacked. Self-hosting is thus less of an option.
* <a id="13:43.13">13:43.13 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: jaduncan[m]: have you considered reclaim hosting?
* <a id="13:43.29">13:43.29 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: they will host for you.
* <a id="13:44.43">13:44.43 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I have, and I'm with them at the moment. Problems are these: they have had a lot of downtime, I have to think a lot about disk space for audio recordings, and it is merely a scripted update rather than a fully managed install. There's a lot less protection than having someone else actively manage the whole server.
* <a id="13:47.21">13:47.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I can recommend IndieHosters, if youâ€™re willing to pay and can manage the install via gitlab or similar.
* <a id="13:47.36">13:47.36 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I'd rather either just get a normal withknown account and not have to think too hard about total media storage when I'm in the back end of beyond. I didn't think they were signing people up, hence my excitement when someone had a new account.
* <a id="13:48.06">13:48.06 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Sorry, I donâ€™t about their own hosted accounts.
* <a id="13:48.41">13:48.41 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I'll look at IndieHosters, but I'll be in the middle of the Sahara so I'm rather hoping to find someone where I don't have to reliably have SSH/git/whatnot to sort it out.
* <a id="13:48.49">13:48.49 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: There's a gap in the market, I tell you.
* <a id="13:48.51">13:48.51 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: grins
* <a id="13:50.20">13:50.20 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: There is. And to begin with I thought IndieHosters would be filling it. They donâ€™t offer SSH at all, so thereâ€™s that.
* <a id="13:51.29">13:51.29 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: C'est la vie. Basically, I really want not to be the sysadmin. Maybe I'll have to be. But you see my excitement about the new account. :/
* <a id="13:52.42">13:52.42 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I do. And I totally appreciate your point of view. I went there because they offered SSL when few other hosts were making it easy. Now Dreamhost, for one, does a very simple Letâ€™s Encrypt, so Iâ€™m actually working on moving my Known there.
* <a id="14:02.47">14:02.47 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: why don't you use Known Pro? https://withknown.com/pro/
* <a id="14:03.16">14:03.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Much to my dismay, they don't actually do signups on it.
* <a id="14:03.17">14:03.17 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I would love to give them money for that.
* <a id="14:03.37">14:03.37 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: you emailed them asking for an account?
* <a id="14:04.07">14:04.07 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i'm assuming they would take your money
* <a id="14:04.17">14:04.17 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Yep. I think I got their CS person rather than management though.
* <a id="14:04.24">14:04.24 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: They aren't doing new Known Pro signups in general, apparently.
* <a id="14:04.35">14:04.35 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Hence my extreme interest in someone having a new account.
* <a id="14:04.49">14:04.49 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: oh, i thought they had only ended the free accounts, not the pro accounts.
* <a id="14:07.09">14:07.09 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Oops, no. I got the co-founder. She said no new signups are happening.
* <a id="14:09.11">14:09.11 (GMT)</a> - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: i think she is the CEO now
* <a id="14:15.32">14:15.32 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I've emailed her with an special-snowflake request. I'll see what can be done before looking at IndieHosters or Dreamhost. Thanks to sensiblemn and jeremycherfas for the suggestions, though.
* <a id="18:42.35">18:42.35 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: hi there. i've been attempting to install known on an nginx box. i've been following a tutorial by eliot tucker, but, at the point where I've installed the known environment in an appropriate location, all I get is a blank screen
* <a id="18:45.44">18:45.44 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: any pointers at all would be appreciated

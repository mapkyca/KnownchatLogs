* <a id="06:03.54">06:03.54 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Hey, folks. Is Postgres officially supported in Known?
* <a id="06:04.02">06:04.02 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Same question re: SQLite?
* <a id="08:21.32">08:21.32 (BST)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I can confirm that the bug also occurs on github master. I'll file it. I wonder if this is some kind of F8 change or just some oddness on Reclaim.
* <a id="08:23.03">08:23.03 (BST)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: My test domain still worked on the account that was already signed in, but when I disconnected and reconnected I got the same error.
* <a id="08:23.11">08:23.11 (BST)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: So no software changes there since last time it worked.
* <a id="08:23.15">08:23.15 (BST)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: Oh, FB.

* <a id="11:10.16">11:10.16 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: looks interesting
* <a id="11:10.35">11:10.35 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: might throw a comment about that onto the google group
* <a id="13:23.01">13:23.01 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: dgold As a replacement for the current editor, or to consider instead of Quill?
* <a id="13:23.26">13:23.26 (BST)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Yes, to consider instead of quill
* <a id="13:23.26">13:23.26 (BST)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Quill.js, not quill.p3k
* <a id="13:28.33">13:28.33 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Right. That bit I took as read. ðŸ™‚
* <a id="18:10.11">18:10.11 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: 0.9.2 is going on a year old and I know there have been a ton of fixes.  Any chance on locking in a new release soon?
* <a id="18:10.21">18:10.21 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: Or do you consider master stable enough?
* <a id="18:18.25">18:18.25 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've been asking that same question for a long time, and I finally bit the bullet and switched to master.
* <a id="18:18.25">18:18.25 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It works great.
* <a id="18:21.44">18:21.44 (BST)</a> - __[funwhilelost](https://github.com/funwhilelost)__: cleverdevil: Thanks, will do
* <a id="18:40.58">18:40.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: For those who are interested, I've been working on an "On this day" implementation for Known.
* <a id="18:41.02">18:41.02 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I have it working on my site: https://cleverdevil.io/onthisday/
* <a id="18:41.14">18:41.14 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Shows posts on (or very nearly on) the current day over the years.
* <a id="18:41.38">18:41.38 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That said, it currently requires me to patch Known core to enable "<" and ">" in search queries, which I've only implemented for MySQL.
* <a id="19:28.20">19:28.20 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: cleverdevil++ for on this day, that's awesome!
* <a id="19:28.20">19:28.20 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: cleverdevil has 5 karma in this channel (31 overall)
* <a id="20:12.14">20:12.14 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: cleverdevil: are likes/reposts &c working on master?
* <a id="20:21.58">20:21.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: They seem to be, yes.
* <a id="20:22.12">20:22.12 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That said, there are a few bugs when creating them with Micropub via Quill, which I've opened issues with in GitHub, including examples.
* <a id="20:49.53">20:49.53 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold When I looked recently, it appeared to me that likes and reposts were directly built into the core "Like" plugin in master rather than needing the separate KnownReactions plugin for 0.9.2.
* <a id="20:56.52">20:56.52 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: okay - I might just move to master then, and leave reactions out altogether.
* <a id="20:57.06">20:57.06 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I think that will mean that my existing reactions will be lost, though
* <a id="21:05.06">21:05.06 (BST)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Hmm, I have just enabled the core likes and reposts and then disabled reactions, don't see them though. Am I doing something wrong?
* <a id="21:06.43">21:06.43 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Are you running the latest from master?
* <a id="21:09.10">21:09.10 (BST)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: I'm hosted, is it easy to tell?
* <a id="21:09.30">21:09.30 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If you're hosted, you're almost certainly not running master.
* <a id="21:09.50">21:09.50 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That's really a question for Known The Company, though.
* <a id="21:11.24">21:11.24 (BST)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Ah well, I'll just re-enable the plugin for now
* <a id="21:12.03">21:12.03 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, for my On This Day plugin, I am curious if a pull requests to Core would be accepted that implements a feature *only* in the MySQL backend, and not in PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB.
* <a id="21:12.09">21:12.09 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: From my understanding, MongoDB is deprecated.
* <a id="21:12.13">21:12.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, that's likely out.

* <a id="06:34.38">06:34.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Thanks chrisaldrich and schmarty I took a quick look at Screech. Could be interesting for shorter audio, like I used to do on ADN and 10C. My main outlet is WP with Blubrry plugin hosted at S3. I don't know how Known handles the RSS for iTunes feeds.
* <a id="06:37.43">06:37.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: aaronpk the naming caused no end of confusion in git issues. They've gone back to tinymce for now, but I prefer markdown anyway. It would be good to be able to switch to see raw but that doesn't seem on the cards.
* <a id="06:42.26">06:42.26 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: NewsBlur is a reader that also makes cross posting to silos easy. I've never thought of asking Samuel Clay to extend that to Known, but I will.
* <a id="08:23.01">08:23.01 (GMT)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: What was the editor that you based quill on called, aaronpk?
* <a id="12:53.46">12:53.46 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: chrisaldrich what workflow are you using to get the tweets fully shown on stream.boffo?
* <a id="13:39.43">13:39.43 (GMT)</a> - __[martymcguire[m]](https://github.com/martymcguire[m])__: [kevinmarks]: i think it's medium-editor: https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor
* <a id="14:33.45">14:33.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: dgold Getting an error from pnut on trying to authorize your plugin. It says `Client error`. NO more details than that.
* <a id="14:39.03">14:39.03 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Somewhat confused whether I need a token for myself, which seems different from the Client ID and Client Secret
* <a id="14:40.38">14:40.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Jeremy, I used the id & secret from pnut
* <a id="14:41.32">14:41.32 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Will uninstall and reinstall to reproduce your error. But that'll have to wait til tomorrow I'm afraid. Today is the last day of the 6nations üèâ
* <a id="14:42.04">14:42.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Italy were hockeyed by the Scots, I'm afraid.
* <a id="14:43.07">14:43.07 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: It's a two stage process:
* <a id="14:43.26">14:43.26 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: First you need to create an app in pnut with secret & id
* <a id="14:43.48">14:43.48 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: You need to put the callback URL as per the admin->pnut page
* <a id="14:44.10">14:44.10 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Then you authenticate the user in account->pnut
* <a id="14:49.31">14:49.31 (GMT)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: I think that's what I did. Will disable and try again. Enjoy the rugby

* <a id="16:17.24">16:17.24 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold to show tweets on Known (as a share/note), I'm usually just inputting the raw URL of the tweet. Known fetches the data and converts it to a twitter card automatically.
* <a id="16:17.24">16:17.24 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: While it looks good, this is a dodgy game if/when Twitter should go down as you'll just be left with the URL and not have a copy of the content.  Better is to go to twitter and get the embed details and cut and paste the particular tweet you want.
* <a id="16:17.36">16:17.36 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Sadly this last method doesn't work well with repost using KnownReactions plugin

* <a id="16:21.41">16:21.41 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: So much of it is wrapped up with the external libraries, I can't fathom it at all.

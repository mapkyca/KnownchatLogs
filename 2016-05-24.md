* <a id="02:51.33">02:51.33 (BST)</a> - __[SP__](https://github.com/SP__)__: Hi, I recently created a test known site and setup the twitter plugin. The portal seems to be receiving webmentions but does not display them. My error log says - error - "Could not find handler for <target link>". Any leads to what could be happening?

* <a id="16:51.21">16:51.21 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: howdy
* <a id="16:51.23">16:51.23 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: benwerd: rMdes left you a message on 3/24 at 3:00pm: Do we have a Known channel for community-devs ? one where we could have a bot sending New issues on the Known github or update the channel when plugins get updated, stuff like this, what do you think about it ?
* <a id="16:51.40">16:51.40 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: oops, that was two months ago
* <a id="16:51.50">16:51.50 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I think this is that channel
* <a id="16:54.25">16:54.25 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: loqi is a bit luggish today it seems ;)
* <a id="16:56.10">16:56.10 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not sure, but I think @rmdes was talking about a Known hosted group, but I'm not sure
* <a id="16:56.19">16:56.19 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'd say IRC is where it's at
* <a id="16:56.44">16:56.44 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (when it works for me - freenode is a bit flakey, although it seems to be ok this week)
* <a id="16:56.52">16:56.52 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: the problem with IRC is that it turns a lot of people away - given that it feels like the mid-nineties internet - but for development it seems okay
* <a id="16:57.08">16:57.08 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: (or mid-seventies internet; point is, it's not slick)
* <a id="16:57.27">16:57.27 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: meh... i think a lot of projects use it as a bit of a filter to keep the conversation technical
* <a id="16:57.49">16:57.49 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: it's also low bandwidth and based on an open protocol
* <a id="16:58.33">16:58.33 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I think they do - it's actually a sort of elitism, but again, for technical channels it's probably ok
* <a id="16:58.44">16:58.44 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not entirely encrypted, which is bad, but at least it's not entirely corporate owned like slack
* <a id="16:58.53">16:58.53 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: for anything that requires a broad swath of users, I'd want to use something actually-usable
* <a id="16:58.55">16:58.55 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: elitism has its place
* <a id="16:59.37">16:59.37 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (plus, there are numerous fancy front ends for irc these days, not that I use any)
* <a id="17:00.08">17:00.08 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: they all suck
* <a id="17:00.32">17:00.32 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I think there's a dissonance where many technical communities don't really understand usability beyond some polish applied right at the end
* <a id="17:01.00">17:01.00 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: or worse, want to reclaim the late-nineties internet, when it was essentially just a bunch of rich white guys
* <a id="17:01.21">17:01.21 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: *benwerd rant over ;)*
* <a id="17:01.46">17:01.46 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm slightly more relaxed about this than you, after all, there was a time in the development of everything where it sucked.
* <a id="17:01.51">17:01.51 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: true
* <a id="17:02.27">17:02.27 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I think for me the question is: the internet is the most accessible it's ever been. 3 billion people (!) are online. how can we serve them better, without having them give up the benefits it's brought them?
* <a id="17:02.38">17:02.38 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: (because they won't)
* <a id="17:02.49">17:02.49 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: benwerd, I think the "serve" framing is too patronizing
* <a id="17:03.00">17:03.00 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: tantek: that's fair
* <a id="17:03.12">17:03.12 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: yes, but you're always having a go at me when I start bringing ideology into technical discussions
* <a id="17:03.29">17:03.29 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not that I necessarily disagree with you
* <a id="17:03.43">17:03.43 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I just think we need to do the best we can with what we can
* <a id="17:03.52">17:03.52 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: that, I also agree with
* <a id="17:04.16">17:04.16 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: there's a difference between serving, and enabling/empowering, and I think that difference is important because it's about agency and independence
* <a id="17:04.27">17:04.27 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: people in jail are served meals too
* <a id="17:04.54">17:04.54 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I can get on board with empowering as a goal
* <a id="17:05.16">17:05.16 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: (Design is still vital there, of course)
* <a id="17:06.43">17:06.43 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: yes, it's all part of life's rich tapestry :P
* <a id="17:13.27">17:13.27 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: on that note -- *runs to work*
* <a id="17:14.14">17:14.14 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: lol, and I'm off to kick people in the head.
* <a id="17:14.25">17:14.25 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not related to ben's last
* <a id="20:05.30">20:05.30 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: BTW, on the point of serving vs enabling and "billions of people are online", consider this data point: http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedia-zero-rating-facebook-free-basics-is-censoring-developing-world-internet
* <a id="20:06.00">20:06.00 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: !tell benwerd,mapkyca on the point of serving vs enabling and "billions of people are online", consider this data point: http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedia-zero-rating-facebook-free-basics-is-censoring-developing-world-internet
* <a id="20:06.00">20:06.00 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next

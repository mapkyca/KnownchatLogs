* <a id="04:46.48">04:46.48 (BST)</a> - __[Ruxton](https://github.com/Ruxton)__: heyo! trying to import WordPress xml, from a 10-year WordPress site, had some fun (nginx timeouts and stuff) but now it's imported, there's some obvious issues.  Mant imported posts are actually be photos, but there's no way to make that happen. There's other things like it completely ignoring media and not importing media attachment relationships, has anyone out there had a successful WordPress import??

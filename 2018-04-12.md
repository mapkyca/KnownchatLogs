* <a id="16:25.25">16:25.25 (BST)</a> - __[dosch[m]](https://github.com/dosch[m])__: Is there a way to contribute translations to known?
* <a id="16:27.00">16:27.00 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Yep! the current "blessed" method is gettext, and there's a corpus file in /languages/ for the main stuff, and then a similar directory in plugin dirs for each plugin.
* <a id="16:27.43">16:27.43 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: the file doesn't represent every string at the moment, and I'm slowly adding translation hooks as I go. PRs of course welcome for those too

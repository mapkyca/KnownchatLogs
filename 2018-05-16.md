* <a id="00:53.46">00:53.46 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: no webmention for me here. None of WordPress either, someone's out to quiet me
* <a id="10:48.23">10:48.23 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Turned off convoy but that seems to be the only way for me to syndicate to Twitter. When I use the Twitter butoon left it doesn't work.
* <a id="10:58.44">10:58.44 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: to the discussion or publishing private and public notes txti.es looks great
* <a id="15:01.16">15:01.16 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: !tell [jgmac1106] You should be able to enable syndication by installing the twitter standalone plugin
* <a id="15:01.16">15:01.16 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="15:37.59">15:37.59 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @mapkyca I have that installed. Wondering if some convoy stuff in my config.ini file but that doesn't make sense
* <a id="16:00.22">16:00.22 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @mapkyca it isn't me syndication but my webmentions not working, they just stopped one day. it was weird. They were working on .9.2 and .9.9 then stopped and I updated to GitHub and no webmentions
* <a id="18:06.22">18:06.22 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/jgmac1106">@jgmac1106</a>] Back to directly publishing on Twitter until I get me #indieweb life sorted. No webmentions for some reason on @withknown and no working endpoints for MicroPub on WordPress. #StuckInASiloWithYou (http://twtr.io/1dug2KawD0o)

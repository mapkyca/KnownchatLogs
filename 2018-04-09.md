* <a id="11:54.15">11:54.15 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Any tutorials to getting started with Known? Prefer YouTube.
* <a id="13:04.49">13:04.49 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [unoabraham] What do you need help with?
* <a id="13:08.21">13:08.21 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: [jgmac1106] Myself a Linux noob, and the Digital Ocean tutorial is not up yet.
* <a id="13:08.21">13:08.21 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Basically anything that will list the commands for installation and getting started.
* <a id="13:08.40">13:08.40 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: You host at DO?
* <a id="13:08.50">13:08.50 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: No Reclaim Hosting
* <a id="13:09.12">13:09.12 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Sorry, I meant unoabraham, not you [jgmac1106]
* <a id="13:09.20">13:09.20 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I used to use Installatron so it only supports up to 9.2
* <a id="13:09.47">13:09.47 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Now I just download 9.9 and transfer everything via FTP and I am done
* <a id="13:09.52">13:09.52 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I host at DreamHost and I just uploaded the master to a subdomain there and it worked.
* <a id="13:10.24">13:10.24 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: . 99 I think. Forgetting their versioning number
* <a id="13:10.53">13:10.53 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yup. Some good recent fixes in master.
* <a id="13:14.05">13:14.05 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [jeremycherfas] yeah finally got going on updating on my instances. Have too many. Started with mission critical. Miss those auto updates
* <a id="13:15.07">13:15.07 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I STILL haven't cloned the repository into my site because of difficulties a long time ago with the DB, but it works well enough even without.
* <a id="13:50.36">13:50.36 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: [jeremycherfas] Yes at DO. Use ServerPilot and WordPress.
* <a id="13:50.56">13:50.56 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And you have SFTP access?
* <a id="13:51.03">13:51.03 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Yes.
* <a id="13:51.52">13:51.52 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Do you want your Known instance to be a sub-domain of the domain that you have WP on?
* <a id="13:52.13">13:52.13 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: A few people do that, notably chrisaldrich.
* <a id="13:52.44">13:52.44 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: That is what I do as well
* <a id="13:52.58">13:52.58 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: No, will use a domain. Going to have a play with it first.
* <a id="13:53.24">13:53.24 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: And no, don't plan to use a subdomain.
* <a id="13:53.27">13:53.27 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Then it really is simple. Are you going to clone the master into your domain?
* <a id="13:55.17">13:55.17 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: I don't understand what that means, but I'm assuming it means will I move my existing site/content to Known?
* <a id="13:55.17">13:55.17 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Yes, if it works well and is easy to do so.
* <a id="13:56.05">13:56.05 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: On WordPress right now, and it's too much of an overkill for my daily microblogging needs.
* <a id="13:57.00">13:57.00 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: No, that's not what it means. No matter. Go to https://github.com/idno/Known and download the zipfile.
* <a id="13:57.00">13:57.00 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [idno] Known: A social publishing platform.
* <a id="13:58.02">13:58.02 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Unzip and upload all the files to the domain you will be using.
* <a id="13:58.25">13:58.25 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: It takes longer, but in the end is simpler than uploading the zip and unzipping on DO.
* <a id="14:00.34">14:00.34 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Ok. FileZilla is uploading.
* <a id="14:00.38">14:00.38 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Once you have done that, the next step depends on what database you are using. If it is MySQL (which it probably is) you can just point your browser to the URL where you installed Known.
* <a id="14:01.00">14:01.00 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: See http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/instructions/ under Configure Known.
* <a id="14:01.58">14:01.58 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: Ok. Thanks.

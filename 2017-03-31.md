* <a id="14:20.45">14:20.45 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: So one thing I'm wondering is as more content type plugins are created in Known, should the plugin have a way to register its own Micropub support too?
* <a id="14:21.06">14:21.06 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: otherwise the Micropub function is going to get really big and will be dependent on plugins
* <a id="15:17.05">15:17.05 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: probably... should be easy enough to accomplish. Trigger an event maybe, and kick the can down the road...
* <a id="15:17.36">15:17.36 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah, and if no plugin catches a micropub request, the micropub plugin can handle it in a default way

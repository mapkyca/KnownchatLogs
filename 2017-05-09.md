* <a id="15:14.27">15:14.27 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Just flagging this here, since it's a fairly big change: I've run into a data corruption problem caused by <a href="https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1741">#1741</a>, for which I am proposing tombstoning deleted items (by default not deleting objects, mearly marking them as so). With modifications to database recall functions, this will allow for UUIDs to remain unique, even if they're the same as previously deleted objects.

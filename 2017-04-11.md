* <a id="18:05.38">18:05.38 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'd like to have a page "/stream" on my Known site that displays Bookmarks and Status Updates.
* <a id="18:05.47">18:05.47 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I know I can link to `/content/bookmarkedpages/statusupdates`, but I'd prefer the more terse `/stream`.
* <a id="18:06.17">18:06.17 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I was thinking about accomplishing this with an `.htaccess` entry using `RewriteRule`, but I can't seem to figure it out. Is there a best practice for this?
* <a id="18:06.22">18:06.22 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Has anyone else done something similar?
* <a id="18:06.29">18:06.29 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: (I'd like to map a few of these, FWIW)
* <a id="20:04.55">20:04.55 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: cleverdevil Another option would be to do a 301 redirect in your .htaccess
* <a id="20:06.09">20:06.09 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Redirect 301 /stream/ http://cleverdevil.io/content/bookmarkedpages/statusupdates
* <a id="20:06.35">20:06.35 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, I've had that working, but at that point, I might as well just leave it.
* <a id="20:06.48">20:06.48 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I want the clean URL everywhere ðŸ˜‰

* <a id="20:08.08">20:08.08 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'm gonna keep tinkering. I am *sure* there's a way to do it.
* <a id="20:08.13">20:08.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: But, its a bit annoyingly complex right now.
* <a id="20:08.35">20:08.35 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've also considered just creating a directory called `timeline` with an `index.php` that does the needful.
* <a id="20:08.46">20:08.46 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That'd also be fine with me, if I could figure out how to do that ðŸ™‚

* <a id="22:09.47">22:09.47 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its pretty simple, once you know how to do it. I still wish it could be done with htaccess (it probably can), but at least this works for now.

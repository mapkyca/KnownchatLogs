* <a id="11:04.21">11:04.21 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: !tell [jeremycherfas] The media plugin (aka audio) *sortof* supports video, but performs no transcoding or anything. Video is hard, hence why the functionality was deprecated. YMMV
* <a id="11:04.21">11:04.21 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="11:05.48">11:05.48 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Thanks. I’m just not sure how even to select the video file from my desktop. It just doesn’t show up. Could I embed the video and host it somewhere else?
* <a id="11:06.38">11:06.38 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Youtube links in posts automatically get expanded into the player, so you could use that
* <a id="11:07.03">11:07.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I mostly use Vimeo; I’ll try that first.
* <a id="11:14.25">11:14.25 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: iirc there's also vimeo unfurling...
* <a id="11:15.33">11:15.33 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Cool. Thanks.
* <a id="14:25.31">14:25.31 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: Video is hard if you place high requirements on dealing with it. I just post MP4 files and use a video tag and it works in most browsers and even on iOS and it's Good Enough for me
* <a id="14:29.59">14:29.59 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Hi aaronpk. I would be OK doing that if I were coding the HTML myself. But I was trying to upload a video from my desktop machine with the Known edit interface, and it won’t even allow me to select a video.
* <a id="14:30.07">14:30.07 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: However, you have given me an idea …
* <a id="14:31.31">14:31.31 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: I mean a simple solution for Known is to just allow uploading video files and not do anything fancy with them on the server
* <a id="14:33.14">14:33.14 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: That would be ideal, I agree.
* <a id="14:34.01">14:34.01 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: My idea didn’t work. I thought maybe I would be able to place a still image and then edit the source for that post to point to a different file, but Known hashes the filename and stuff so that looks way more work than it is worth.
* <a id="14:36.19">14:36.19 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: @aaronpk: that is essentially what already happens - the audio plugin also supports video (originally it was just called "media"), but this has been kept on the QT since it didn't work too well. It's just s/audio/media/g in labels afaik
* <a id="14:37.54">14:37.54 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’m just refreshing my memory in https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1682 and thinking that I will try that even before I try to embed from Vimeo.
* <a id="14:43.36">14:43.36 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Very interesting.That works fine https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/2017/test-of-audiogram-upload-directly-to-known although there is no indication from the player that you are looking at a video rather than pure audio.
* <a id="15:20.40">15:20.40 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: So, that works in FF, but doesn't do anything in chrome. IIRC this was one of the problems we were having with the video tag...
* <a id="15:21.38">15:21.38 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: although that might well be to do with mediaelement-and-player js
* <a id="15:21.54">15:21.54 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Seems to be chucking out a DOMException...
* <a id="15:23.04">15:23.04 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I got hijacked; haven’t yet tried a Vimeo embed
* <a id="15:37.26">15:37.26 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: The embed fails to visualize the iFrame.

* <a id="16:24.05">16:24.05 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: it seems my url's return a /index.php/ that should not be even there
* <a id="16:26.12">16:26.12 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: o/
* <a id="16:27.00">16:27.00 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: rMdes: want to share you nginx config?
* <a id="16:27.32">16:27.32 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: 2 sec, login in
* <a id="16:28.30">16:28.30 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: wow it's not nginx my bad
* <a id="16:28.53">16:28.53 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: it's good old htaccess
* <a id="16:29.03">16:29.03 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: and it's on a shared hosting
* <a id="16:33.43">16:33.43 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: kylewm, there we go : http://pastebin.com/UQquKu91
* <a id="16:34.14">16:34.14 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i think i'm using the default htaccess, maybe not the latest, not sure if it changed over versions
* <a id="16:34.55">16:34.55 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I think the culprit is this line here :     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}/index.php?/$1 [L,QSA]
* <a id="16:35.10">16:35.10 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: but I'm not confortable at all with htaccess
* <a id="16:36.12">16:36.12 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I don't know if I can just remove index.php from that line and have it like     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}/$1 [L,QSA] ?
* <a id="16:36.57">16:36.57 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: that seems strange to me, I didn't expect rewrite rules would *redirect* to /index.php
* <a id="16:37.54">16:37.54 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i just checked the original htaccess-dist and it also have this line
* <a id="16:37.58">16:37.58 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: huh, https://www.rmendes.net/s/JKoP seems to work
* <a id="16:38.07">16:38.07 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: my htaccess just have a few lines to force HTTPS
* <a id="16:38.59">16:38.59 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: very strange when I click the short link from facebook syndicated copy I get the error
* <a id="16:39.01">16:39.01 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: https://www.facebook.com/rickmendesg/posts/1737567203132091
* <a id="16:39.31">16:39.31 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: if I click the link you just gave (witch is the same theorically) it works indeed
* <a id="16:39.41">16:39.41 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: the redirect from http://www.rmendes.net/s/JKoP to https is what's adding the index.php
* <a id="16:40.23">16:40.23 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: hmmm so I may be using a rule that appear to work, but it's not 100% case scenario
* <a id="16:42.10">16:42.10 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i think my problem is having 2 specification to force HTTPS
* <a id="16:42.56">16:42.56 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: the one at the top with ps:env HTTPS and the one at the end : RewriteEngine On
* <a id="16:42.56">16:42.56 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
* <a id="16:42.56">16:42.56 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
* <a id="16:43.45">16:43.45 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I guess I have not yet finished to find the best htaccess set of rules to fix this HTTPS thing
* <a id="16:44.25">16:44.25 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: you could try asking bear in indiewebcamp ... he's the expert on this stuff :)
* <a id="16:47.34">16:47.34 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: thanks kylewm i'll ask him
* <a id="16:47.50">16:47.50 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: I think dreamhost added one line to achieve that and I added another one
* <a id="16:48.14">16:48.14 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: so I commented everything until i find the best rule to force https always
* <a id="16:51.57">16:51.57 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: rMdes: oh you know, it's a holiday in the US, he might not be around
* <a id="16:52.15">16:52.15 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: of course no worries
* <a id="16:52.40">16:52.40 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i'll stay around and experiment from a clean htaccess
* <a id="16:53.08">16:53.08 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: there is so much opinions about this on google that it's actually difficult to know what tutorial to follow
* <a id="16:53.18">16:53.18 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: yeah no doubt
* <a id="16:54.51">16:54.51 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: maybe trying adding the 'L' flag to the https rule to get it to stop after applying it
* <a id="16:54.53">16:54.53 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [L,env=ps:https]
* <a id="16:58.57">16:58.57 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: trying now
* <a id="16:59.02">16:59.02 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: thanks
* <a id="17:02.06">17:02.06 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: kylewm, i found the real culprit
* <a id="17:02.08">17:02.08 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
* <a id="17:02.32">17:02.32 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: but that's chinese to me, but that's what actually enforce HTTPS on my host
* <a id="17:03.12">17:03.12 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: not the env:ps https at the top (i commented those lines now to isolate the issue)
* <a id="17:10.12">17:10.12 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh way down at the bottom, i didn't even see that one
* <a id="17:13.37">17:13.37 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: kylewm, i'm able to enforce HTTPS using other instructions, clearly proposed by Dreamhost itself
* <a id="17:13.52">17:13.52 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: but can't avoid this index.php when coming from HTTP
* <a id="17:20.56">17:20.56 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: huh, yeah I'm not sure, I don't know apache very well
* <a id="17:30.57">17:30.57 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i'm still digging will find out

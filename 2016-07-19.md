The channel is pretty quiet right now, so I thought I'd say hello, and ping some people (like benwerd, mapkyca, and kylewm) that you're here.  If no one responds for a while, try posting on our development mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev or just try coming back later.

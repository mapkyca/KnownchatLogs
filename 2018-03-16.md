Or is the project only leaning towards education usage? Can you or @erinjo or @benwerd clarify plan for public sector? http://known.cloud is based on Known and want to keep it alive #blog #Known #community #art #write (http://twtr.io/1bhq5Rdo0hg)

* <a id="16:44.19">16:44.19 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: If I wanted to add support for notification other than email (say to matrix, slack, other API) is that something I could do via a plugin or would I need to make changes to the core of Known?
* <a id="16:50.44">16:50.44 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I added notifications to a micropub endpoint in a plugin.
* <a id="16:50.53">16:50.53 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its not super duper straightforward, but its possible ðŸ™‚
* <a id="16:51.37">16:51.37 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: https://github.com/cleverdevil/CleverCustomize/blob/master/Main.php#L42
* <a id="16:51.52">16:51.52 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Its mostly just complicated by the fact that I want to generate custom formatted notifications.
* <a id="16:51.55">16:51.55 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If you just want something simple, its pretty easy.
* <a id="16:52.11">16:52.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: TL;DR - `\Idno\Core\site()->addEventHook('notify', function (\Idno\Core\Event $event) {`
* <a id="16:57.55">16:57.55 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: One of the things I wanted to do was a micropub endpoint for a microsub servers, so that is good to know
* <a id="16:59.08">16:59.08 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That's exactly what I am doing.
* <a id="16:59.17">16:59.17 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Sending notifications to a Microsub channel.
* <a id="17:00.29">17:00.29 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: [cleverdevil]: $notifications_endpoint = \Idno\Core\Idno::site()->config()->notifications_endpoint; that is in the config file not a setting?
* <a id="17:06.54">17:06.54 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, that's a line from my plugin.
* <a id="17:07.06">17:07.06 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: You'll need to create your own plugin that uses that same logic.
* <a id="17:07.15">17:07.15 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: See the above link to my GItHub repo.
* <a id="17:07.41">17:07.41 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: yeah, but where are you putting the actual value of notification_endpoint?
* <a id="17:08.11">17:08.11 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: I already copied your plugin the other day and made changes to it, as I am trying to get the microblog feed template you have working, just did not notice this part of the code.
* <a id="17:08.19">17:08.19 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Ah, gotcha.
* <a id="17:08.26">17:08.26 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I put it in the config file.
* <a id="17:08.33">17:08.33 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: (For Known)
* <a id="17:08.45">17:08.45 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: cool
* <a id="19:27.18">19:27.18 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: [cleverdevil]: I am not sure if this is what you are trying to do, so I will note it here and not in a bug
* <a id="19:27.52">19:27.52 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: This line of code is keeping likes from your time line, https://github.com/cleverdevil/CleverCustomize/blob/2ecaadf92fe94ea2d40b9759080b848d464260e5/templates/microblog/shell.tpl.php#L86
* <a id="19:34.16">19:34.16 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, its intentional ðŸ™‚
* <a id="19:34.43">19:34.43 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: That code is all pretty gross. But, basically I decided I only wanted to syndicate some content to micro.blog, not everything.
* <a id="19:39.41">19:39.41 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: yeah, I used to to block other stuff, I just was not sure if you wanted the likes or not as the code to set it up is before that
* <a id="19:40.03">19:40.03 (GMT)</a> - __[zoglesby](https://github.com/zoglesby)__: and it took me a moment to figure out why my likes did not show up
* <a id="19:40.38">19:40.38 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Gotcha ðŸ™‚

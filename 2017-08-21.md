* <a id="09:13.37">09:13.37 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: mapkyca: jeremycherfas left you a message 21 hours, 48 minutes ago: I asked about the length of the HMAC because I was struck by the coincidence that the final character in two different HMACs - for status/edit and /like/edit - was the same “=“. And when I counted, there were 45 characters, including the “=“. So will try again with 44 chars, but probably not today.

Like I said, check the Known logs - it'll tell you what it's expecting and what the comparison token is being formed over. You should be able to spot where things are going wrong relatively easily...

* <a id="11:56.43">11:56.43 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Wouldn't hurt, but it won't help much with the token generation :) .... that stuff was scratching an itch to allow an API based client to automatically get a sense of what fields were expected for each endpoint

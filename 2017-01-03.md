* <a id="13:54.56">13:54.56 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Oh amazing, thanks mapkyca.
* <a id="13:55.11">13:55.11 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: (for some reason I didn't get notifications for your replies)
* <a id="13:56.01">13:56.01 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Do known installations get updated automatically or do people have to do that by hand?
* <a id="13:56.44">13:56.44 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: I guess you do updates in chunks as versioned releases?
* <a id="13:56.51">13:56.51 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: (forgive my ignorance..)
* <a id="13:57.48">13:57.48 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: oh I see, that's your fork
* <a id="13:58.06">13:58.06 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: That looks about right, from skimming the code
* <a id="14:00.33">14:00.33 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: hosted version get updated automatically, although that's not up to me :) self hosted versions will need to be updated by hand. I generally just track HEAD on a git checkout, which makes checking branches a bit easier...
* <a id="14:01.02">14:01.02 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: (famous last words) this patch shouldn't break anything, so I might just merge it down...
* <a id="14:05.06">14:05.06 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Okay. I raised this issue not because it's affecting my Known installation, but because everyone else's Known having this bug is causing bridgy to have a bug, which affects my personal site :P
* <a id="14:05.17">14:05.17 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: So I'm invested in everyone else in the world updating, so bridgy can be fixed
* <a id="14:05.25">14:05.25 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Tough life.
* <a id="14:05.32">14:05.32 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: I appreciate you dealing with it so quickly!
* <a id="14:06.00">14:06.00 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: s/causing bridgy to have/causing bridgy to postpone fixing
* <a id="14:09.27">14:09.27 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: heh heh, no worries. I think withknown.com is long overdue an update, so I would hope this'll get updated soonish (might just give ben and erin a nudge to see what their plans are), meanwhile I merge this down so self hosters can begin updating...
* <a id="14:10.06">14:10.06 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Awesome, thanks. I hope it doesn't mess anything else up..
* <a id="14:10.25">14:10.25 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: After snarfed fixed my original issue with bridgy, every Known installation stopped getting webmentions. I felt bad.
* <a id="14:10.42">14:10.42 (GMT)</a> - __[rhiaro](https://github.com/rhiaro)__: Hoping not to keep cascading this :)

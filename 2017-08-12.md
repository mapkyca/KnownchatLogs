* <a id="19:13.13">19:13.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: weird... something is going on with all of my Known installations...
* <a id="19:13.13">19:13.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I am getting a "DOMDocument is not found" error
* <a id="19:13.13">19:13.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Anyone else?
* <a id="19:36.15">19:36.15 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: Not me. Are they all on the same backend?
* <a id="19:40.55">19:40.55 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, so, I have a workaround.
* <a id="19:41.08">19:41.08 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It appears that it might be something related to an ubuntu update.
* <a id="19:41.47">19:41.47 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: In the meantime, I have bypassed the functionality in `external/MrClay_AutoP/AutoP.php` which depends on `DOMDocument`
* <a id="19:41.52">19:41.52 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Fixed the problem for now.
* <a id="19:41.55">19:41.55 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: But, not the root cause.
* <a id="19:42.08">19:42.08 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I have checked and I have `php7.0-xml` installed on this Xenial system.
* <a id="19:42.51">19:42.51 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: `phpinfo()` shows that the module is enabled.
* <a id="19:42.55">19:42.55 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, I have no idea why its not working.
* <a id="21:19.24">21:19.24 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: @[cleverdevil] this appearing in your logs? Recently I pushed some stuff to capture javascript errors in the log, which I've found useful, but seems to - in some cases - end up being a little noisy
* <a id="21:21.22">21:21.22 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: unrelated: I'm thinking about bringing back the cachebusting machineversion code for javascript and css. @benwerd said this might have caused a slowdown, which is why it was removed, but he wasn't sure... and I can't think of a reason this would cause problems (other than the obvious, lots of folk hitting site with empty cache)... any thoughts?
* <a id="21:32.17">21:32.17 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: @[cleverdevil] Ahh, sorry, reread... not related, my bad
* <a id="22:12.32">22:12.32 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Sorry, back now.
* <a id="22:12.32">22:12.32 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Was out and about
* <a id="22:12.32">22:12.32 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: No, it appears unrelated.
* <a id="22:12.35">22:12.35 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I am having to comment out all references throughout Known and plugins to DOMDocument to keep things running.
* <a id="22:12.46">22:12.46 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've tried reinstalling php7.0-xml, to no avail.
* <a id="22:13.47">22:13.47 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/dom.installation.php ... looks like it can be disabled...
* <a id="22:13.56">22:13.56 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: although it's enabled by default
* <a id="22:16.13">22:16.13 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: https://cleverdevil.io/i.php
* <a id="22:18.33">22:18.33 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've mostly commented stuff out to make it work for now, but I haven't done so on another install on the same server - https://üê∑.ws/content/posts/
* <a id="22:18.44">22:18.44 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: `Fatal Error: /var/www/pigfire.ws/IdnoPlugins/Text/Entry.php:64 - "Uncaught Error: Class 'DOMDocument' not found in /var/www/pigfire.ws/IdnoPlugins/Text/Entry.php:64

* <a id="22:19.20">22:19.20 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Sounds like something to do with the install... it *should* be enabled by default...
* <a id="22:20.26">22:20.26 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah, everything was working fine, it just *suddenly* stopped working.
* <a id="22:20.32">22:20.32 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I have unattended upgrades enabled for security-related setuff.
* <a id="22:20.34">22:20.34 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: stuff.

* <a id="22:29.49">22:29.49 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: DOMDocument is available in PHP if I run it via the CLI.
* <a id="22:30.35">22:30.35 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Maybe something with php-fpm....
* <a id="22:31.23">22:31.23 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yup... that was it.
* <a id="22:31.26">22:31.26 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Weird.
* <a id="22:31.43">22:31.43 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Uninstalled php-fpm, which moved back over to mod_php, and now it works fine.
* <a id="22:33.29">22:33.29 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: weird...
* <a id="22:33.40">22:33.40 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Very weird.
* <a id="22:33.54">22:33.54 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Anyway, fixed üôÇ
* <a id="22:49.49">22:49.49 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, this is an unmanaged VM.

* <a id="22:49.54">22:49.54 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: On our cloud platform.
* <a id="22:49.58">22:49.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: So, its entirely my fault üòâ

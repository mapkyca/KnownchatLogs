* <a id="08:35.58">08:35.58 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: For what it is worth, my Known is version 0.9.9 Build 2017091201 IndiePub version ).2 hosted on a Dreamhost VPS to which I have made no changes.
* <a id="16:48.49">16:48.49 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: The IndiePub plugin is supposedly deprecated, in core. But with that plugin disabled, there are no endpoints visible. Am I missing something?
* <a id="16:50.39">16:50.39 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: @manton: Possible breakthrough. For the firswt time. OSX app has responded with Micropub API settings have been updated. Will now try to post.
* <a id="16:51.35">16:51.35 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: No dice! Error sending post.
* <a id="16:54.46">16:54.46 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Ah, OK. I now understand about the plugin being deprecated. It is still a plugin, but is now part of the Idno plugins. Got it.
* <a id="17:00.29">17:00.29 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not really deprecated, but nobody has had much time to do much dev on it so it's probably suffered from bitrot...
* <a id="17:00.29">17:00.29 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: mapkyca: [cleverdevil] left you a message 1 week, 1 day ago: thanks for letting me know, I went ahead and created an issue here - https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1924 ... happy to provide any additional info!
* <a id="17:02.11">17:02.11 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: mapkyca I have been trying to sort out the problem of posting from the micro.blog app to Known. The hard part is, it works for some people, but not for me.
* <a id="17:03.15">17:03.15 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I have also had difficulty in the past importing a downloaded RSS backup. If there were a guaranteed way of backing up and restoring I would be prepared to attempt a fresh install from the public zip.
* <a id="17:08.40">17:08.40 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: You could try the later builds for import export, and failing data would always be interesting to see. Re microblog, it's probably a connection issue. Hard to debug unless we can get curl output or something from microblog
* <a id="17:09.26">17:09.26 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: but like i said, not really done much dev so it's probably not kept track of api changes
* <a id="17:11.47">17:11.47 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Quill is still OK though.
* <a id="17:13.13">17:13.13 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: likely some quirk between your install/server setup and mb then...
* <a id="17:13.31">17:13.31 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: if, as you say, others are having no problems posting the same things
* <a id="17:13.52">17:13.52 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I think some are having problems and others are not.
* <a id="17:14.11">17:14.11 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: need more data then .. :/
* <a id="17:15.09">17:15.09 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: willing to bet there's something in the response/not in the response which your server is spitting out, that others aren't, but that quill is quietly handling/ignoring
* <a id="17:15.40">17:15.40 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I cannot see anything in my logs.
* <a id="17:15.45">17:15.45 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Would it show there?
* <a id="17:17.08">17:17.08 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: As for import/export, I didn't get much interest when I last mentioned it. :(
* <a id="17:17.49">17:17.49 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: if it's in server response, no. It'll be in the result that mb gets back from the api calls. Can you install a version of MB yourself? I can't recall if it's installable. If you can if you can replicate the fault on that then you could compare the response from your known and a working one elsewhere
* <a id="17:18.05">17:18.05 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: or if you can replicate with just straight curl
* <a id="17:18.26">17:18.26 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: basically you're looking for a difference to the response between working/not working for the same requests
* <a id="17:19.03">17:19.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I don't think one can install micro.blog. But I have suggested to manton that looking at CURL might supply answers.
* <a id="17:28.22">17:28.22 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I‚Äôm just boarding my flight home, but when I‚Äôm up in the air with WiFi I‚Äôll try and reconnect here and see if I can help.
* <a id="17:28.52">17:28.52 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Thanks cleverdevil
* <a id="17:29.01">17:29.01 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Sure thing!
* <a id="17:36.02">17:36.02 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: mapkyca I have access to phpadmin and could export my Known database. Could I then reimport if necessary?
* <a id="17:38.46">17:38.46 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Okay so I‚Äôm delayed in departure sitting at the gate. I can help out for a bit but only from my phone.
* <a id="17:40.37">17:40.37 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It sounds like Quill works, but not Micro.blog. Is that right?
* <a id="17:41.49">17:41.49 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: That is right.
* <a id="17:42.09">17:42.09 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: One common thing I‚Äôve seen that can cause problems is a mismatch between http and https or a prefix mismatch (www.domain.com vs domain.com).
* <a id="17:42.56">17:42.56 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Known is at stream.jeremycherfas.net and both stream and jeremycherfas.nt have Let's Encrypt.
* <a id="17:42.58">17:42.58 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Are you certain that you‚Äôre supplying the proper full URL to Micro.blog and that Known reports the same URL back and forth?
* <a id="17:43.04">17:43.04 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: OK.
* <a id="17:43.39">17:43.39 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It appears that you are allowing both HTTP and HTTPS.
* <a id="17:43.41">17:43.41 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I'm supplying https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/ to micro.blog. DSo you think I should try /profile?
* <a id="17:44.04">17:44.04 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I‚Äôm wondering if you should try bare HTTP?
* <a id="17:44.26">17:44.26 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Maybe Known is reporting the non-SSL endpoint to Micro.blog or something.
* <a id="17:44.32">17:44.32 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I thought I had changed the htaccess. Maybe I haven't
* <a id="17:44.43">17:44.43 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yeah forcing SSL would be wise.
* <a id="17:45.25">17:45.25 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Let me try that first. Maybe I only did it for jeremycherfas.net, not for the sub-domain.
* <a id="17:46.28">17:46.28 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Cool. Let me know what you find! I‚Äôm limited to what I can easily do from my phone until we take off. Once I‚Äôm up in the air I can pull out my laptop and be a little more useful üòÅ
* <a id="17:47.19">17:47.19 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I don't want to disturb your flight!
* <a id="17:47.38">17:47.38 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Not a big deal. Happy to help.
* <a id="17:47.38">17:47.38 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: But I reckon fixing forcing SSL is probably worth doing anyway.
* <a id="17:47.50">17:47.50 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Indeed.
* <a id="17:50.38">17:50.38 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Will this do it:
* <a id="17:50.40">17:50.40 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
* <a id="17:50.40">17:50.40 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
* <a id="17:53.42">17:53.42 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Looks like that worked.
* <a id="17:53.54">17:53.54 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Will try micro.blog again.
* <a id="17:53.59">17:53.59 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Cool. I have something slightly different but if it works roll with it.
* <a id="17:54.22">17:54.22 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: It‚Äôs hard for me to copy/paste from iOS terminal app to here üòÄ
* <a id="17:54.31">17:54.31 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I can believe it.
* <a id="17:55.35">17:55.35 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OK, that didn't work. Will try shifting the end point to /profile.
* <a id="17:55.49">17:55.49 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Can‚Äôt hurt to try!
* <a id="17:57.13">17:57.13 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Still no dice. I may as well record what I tried and then give up again.
* <a id="17:58.06">17:58.06 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Oh no, one more thing to try /profile/jeremy I am a single user, but it can't hurt.
* <a id="17:59.27">17:59.27 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: As I feared ...
* <a id="17:59.52">17:59.52 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: One other thing I‚Äôd consider is setting up a totally fresh install just for testing purposes on the same VPS under a different sub domain.
* <a id="18:00.11">18:00.11 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If it works, then it‚Äôs something specific to that one Known install.
* <a id="18:00.29">18:00.29 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If it doesn‚Äôt then it may be something to do with the VPS configuration.
* <a id="18:01.34">18:01.34 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yup. I had thought of that, although I was also a bit worried about how to export and re-import my DB. The last time I tried that it would not work at all.
* <a id="18:01.58">18:01.58 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I asked ^^^ if I can use export import from phpmyadmin to do that. Could I?
* <a id="18:03.04">18:03.04 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I wouldn‚Äôt bother with export and import.
* <a id="18:03.14">18:03.14 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Just set up a totally fresh and blank Known instance.
* <a id="18:03.38">18:03.38 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yes, but if it works, what then? I don't want to lose the old contents.
* <a id="18:03.49">18:03.49 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: If it works, then we can talk about how to get your data moved, or you can just point the working install to the old database and see if that makes things work.
* <a id="18:04.18">18:04.18 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: MySQL dump and reload is pretty easy. I can help with that if needed later.
* <a id="18:05.25">18:05.25 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Ah, right. Just edit the config.ini?
* <a id="18:05.37">18:05.37 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Yup.
* <a id="18:05.46">18:05.46 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Well, it is getting pretty late here, so I'll maybe save that for tomorrow.
* <a id="18:06.12">18:06.12 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Eliminating possibilities is also extremely useful. Thanks for your help. Safe travels.
* <a id="18:06.26">18:06.26 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Cool. No worries. We will get you working eventually! üòÅ

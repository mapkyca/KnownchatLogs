* 16:35.16 (BST) - __[mapkycaweb](https://github.com/mapkycaweb)__: Just dropping in how I'm making this message :) ... IRC Support for Known: http://mapkyc.me/1KmEIDi
* 17:55.30 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: mapkyca: before I put my foot in my mouth, is this issue really talking about 10 to 60 seconds to load one page?  https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/934#issuecomment-124160420
* 17:56.18 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: the only thing i can think of that would cause that is a missing index on the entities table
* 17:56.30 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: and looking at mysql schema, it doesn't *seem* like it has any indexes
* 18:00.05 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: keys are synonymous with indexes, so unless something has gone wrong installing, the table should be being indexed.
* 18:00.36 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm a little unclear what's going on here, it does seem a little slow given the spec
* 18:01.31 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: but an index on "created desc" could speed up querying for entities initially
* 18:01.44 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: and also possibly on entities_subtype
* 18:01.59 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: entity_subtype*
* 18:03.13 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh my bad, I see that entity_subtype is a key
* 18:03.17 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: but still on created desc
* 18:04.10 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: quite possibly, depends on how things are accessed. When I get back from training I'll fire up a mysql instance with indexless query logging on and see what I get, unless someone else beats me to it :)
* 18:07.50 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: ok actually i see now the key on (owner, created)... think I'm totally wrong
* 18:08.58 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: sorry, I'm glad I checked with you before confusing that thread :P
* 18:09.02 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm wondering whether there's something specific going on - maybe a plugin that's doing something it shouldn't. Hard to say without more data, but it definitely sounds like *something* is up there!
* 21:25.35 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: fyi: the main homepage sql query is horribly inefficient - it's using a filesort temporary table and selecting from the entire db, so I guess that goes some way to explaining #934
* 21:25.56 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I need to cook dinner now, but I'll have a look when I can
* 21:26.06 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: unless someone else gets there
* 21:33.32 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: ruh roh
* 21:33.46 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I'll take a look later on but will be out of action for a while
* 22:12.58 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I'm not a mysql optimisation expert, but I'm wondering whether you need to force the index or something
* 22:15.03 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: but for a start, uuid doesn't have an index, and it's a field you're doing a join on
* 22:15.16 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: also created which you're sorting on
* 22:15.24 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: still haven't isolated the main problem tho
* 22:20.00 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: there's a key on (owner, created), maybe it should just be on created?
* 22:20.32 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: (I was thinking "created desc" earlier because that makes a difference in PG but apparently isn't supported in MySQL)
* 22:26.51 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: iirc keys work incrementally, so keys formed over multiple have to match the first one before they can match the second
* 22:27.20 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: so there should probably be a created on its own when you're not using owner in the where clause
* 22:27.31 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: doesn't seem to solve the problem though....
* 22:27.47 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: at least not on its own
* 22:37.52 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: it *looks* like it's the "in (....)" queries that are throwing it off... mysql seems to be deciding to do a full scan.
* 22:38.12 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: a force index *may* be what we're looking for, but like I said, I'm not an expert
* 22:38.21 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: ... and now I've got dinner

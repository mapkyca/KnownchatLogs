* <a id="13:36.00">13:36.00 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: !tell mapcyka I updated to latest master and my layout is seriously messed up from where it was before. Top menu no longer centred. Age of post no longer Xdays ago, BUT the tags from OYG now come through as tags, so that's a definite win. Unfortunately, the image itself is not showing. No idea where to begin trying to sort this out. Was it just the photo plugin template file you changed?
* <a id="13:36.01">13:36.01 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="13:36.46">13:36.46 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And additional error if I actually try to use one of the tags: The requested URL /tag/+#sourdough was not found on this server.
* <a id="13:38.31">13:38.31 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: None of the URLs at /account/ is reachable. All give a 404

* <a id="13:44.40">13:44.40 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I wonder whether it might be an htaccess issue? Home page is visible at https://stream.jeremycherfas.net but nothing beyond that.
* <a id="13:55.28">13:55.28 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: It was indeed the htaccess file; phew.
* <a id="13:56.45">13:56.45 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: mapkyca++ for improvements to tag handling.

* <a id="14:24.46">14:24.46 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Looks like this is missing on your site atm...
* <a id="14:27.03">14:27.03 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Thanks. Yeah, needed to replace the htaccess. Currently busy turning what was a copy of the repo into a proper clone of the repo so I don't have more tourble in future keeping up to date.
* <a id="14:27.12">14:27.12 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Site is probably not functioning now.

We are no longer accepting new signups for the hosted platform, but you can still create a personal site with our open source package. https://withknown.com/opensource/ (http://twtr.io/1eBeE2o2_A8)
* <a id="15:25.38">15:25.38 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: This is weird. OYG is fetching the caption and tags of a post, but the photo itself does not seem to be published on Known.

* <a id="14:16.15">14:16.15 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: for the tape, I've recently fixed an issue, <a href="https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1864">#1864</a>, which may cause duplicate slugs to be generated when run along side ACLs. There's a tool - https://github.com/mapkyca/FixSlugBug - which should fix the datamodel if you are experiencing these issues. It'll also scan for issues related to this and <a href="https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1741">#1741</a>

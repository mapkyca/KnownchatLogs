* <a id="18:43.00">18:43.00 (BST)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: I just thought I'd check in with people - I've just filed https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1674 on the basis that bridgy webmentions are being ordered by webmention receipt time rather than the dt-published mf2 property. Is anyone else seeing this behaviour?

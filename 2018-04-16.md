* <a id="07:30.01">07:30.01 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Morning folks. For the tape I pushed a CLI installer update last night. This was done to solve a specific problem I was having on a client site, but might be useful to others. Takes settings from a manifest file, or if there's settings missing that it needs it'll go interractive and ask
* <a id="08:09.46">08:09.46 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [<a href="https://twitter.com/mapkyca">@mapkyca</a>] The latest @withknown build has a command line installer. Wrote this to solve a specific problem I was having, but hopefully will be useful to other folk... (http://twtr.io/1cp3nYtMAYY)
* <a id="11:04.52">11:04.52 (BST)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: mapkyca, you think there is any way to trigger the cli installer from a composer create-project? That might make Known extremely easy to install for people who already have composer running. (https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#create-project)
* <a id="12:51.47">12:51.47 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Zegnat: if composer can trigger scripts I see no reason why not. I confess I'm not massively familiar with composer :)
* <a id="12:54.53">12:54.53 (BST)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Iâ€™ll give it a look when I am free this afternoon. I would love to be able to spin-up Known that way. I think Laravel has a similar thing available.
* <a id="13:11.08">13:11.08 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: @zegnat and @mapkyca what is the best place to download latest version as I update my Known sites?  Been just using 9.9 from withknown.com
* <a id="13:14.42">13:14.42 (BST)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: I know several people are using the in-development version straight from GitHub. Of course it comes without guarantees, but I think it has gotten pretty far from the latest release now. (Someone who is actively using Known might correct me.)
* <a id="13:15.03">13:15.03 (BST)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Paging jeremycherfas for the current state ... ;)
* <a id="13:16.13">13:16.13 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Zegnat: I do pretty much want to end up where Known functions very much as an engine (as well as a publishing site) in much the same way as laravel. I use Known as an engine for a bunch of things, and it'd be very useful to be able to quickly spin things up like that
* <a id="13:17.30">13:17.30 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: [jgmac1106] I recommend that people don't use the current release binary and use github instead... release is almost a year old at this point and github has much in the way of features and bugfixes
* <a id="13:17.50">13:17.50 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: YMMV of course, but I run bleeding edge on my sites and I've not had any problems
* <a id="13:24.43">13:24.43 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Thanks. The main branch? I saw your discussion about dev branches. if you are doing all the development work @mapkyca do you have a Patreon or anything. I still pay $60 annually for Known not bc I need to but because I like feeding developers who build stuff for me
* <a id="13:25.35">13:25.35 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: But if you are doing all the the work I'd rather see you get support (even my $5 a month)
* <a id="13:26.58">13:26.58 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Most folks I know won't update past 9.2 as that is last thing available in Installatron
* <a id="13:27.31">13:27.31 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I need to make a tutorial showing people how to download and then update their site from sftp.
* <a id="13:41.30">13:41.30 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: What mapkyca said reflects my my less well-informed experience too. I am usually one or two commits behind the master, but have no difficulties at all.
* <a id="13:45.42">13:45.42 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: [jeremycherfas] and @mapkyca okay just forked the repo. Going to focus on the read.me as well as much of the information is no longer correct (i.e. ReClaim Hosting no supports Known)
* <a id="13:47.04">13:47.04 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I am assuming this still allies when uploading from the repo: "Overwrite your Known files except your upload directory and your config.ini file"
* <a id="15:00.50">15:00.50 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: [jgmac1106] Yep, protect the upload directory and config. Backing up your database is also prudent (especially if you're rolling up from a really old version as there are a few schema changes) :)
* <a id="15:01.52">15:01.52 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: No, no patrion :D but thanks!
* <a id="16:11.12">16:11.12 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Thanks Marcus. Most of my instances are 9.2. My most used are  current with last published release. Will spend time updating all the blogs

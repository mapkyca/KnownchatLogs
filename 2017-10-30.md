* <a id="21:22.22">21:22.22 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: Hi. What's the best way to extract the slug from a full post URL in known?
* <a id="21:22.22">21:22.22 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: cweiske: jeremycherfas left you a message on 2017-08-18 at 1:38pm UTC: Thanks for tip on using your Known video plugin. Will try that when I have another video to upload.
* <a id="21:25.03">21:25.03 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: @cweiske all slugs are attached to the ->slug attribute on the object itself
* <a id="21:25.33">21:25.33 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: I have an URL like http://known.bogo/2017/test-14 and want to extract the slug from that url
* <a id="21:26.18">21:26.18 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: and Entity does not have a getByUrl() method
* <a id="21:26.24">21:26.24 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: only getBySlug()
* <a id="21:26.41">21:26.41 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: previously (a year ago) getByUUID() worked, because for posts the uuid was the URL
* <a id="21:26.46">21:26.46 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: this changed somewhere in the last year
* <a id="21:26.53">21:26.53 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: s/where/time/
* <a id="21:27.31">21:27.31 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: now I have to use getBySlug(), but have to get the slug first. micropub clients send the full post URL though
* <a id="21:27.57">21:27.57 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Yeah, there's no getbyurl ... the old behaviour of the uuid was unsafe
* <a id="21:28.28">21:28.28 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: not sure if you can use the pagehandler regex in reverse, don't think thats natively supported
* <a id="21:29.05">21:29.05 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: are slashes allowed in slugs? if not, I could simply explode the string
* <a id="21:29.19">21:29.19 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: no, I don't believe they are
* <a id="21:30.23">21:30.23 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: just tried it, they get stripped out
* <a id="21:30.26">21:30.26 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: ok, then I can use that
* <a id="21:34.48">21:34.48 (GMT)</a> - __[cweiske](https://github.com/cweiske)__: I wanted to write a blog post about adding comments and likes to known posts via micropub and saw that this was broken :/
* <a id="21:35.52">21:35.52 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: The micropub implementation could really use some love ðŸ˜•
* <a id="21:35.54">21:35.54 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I've had it on my list of things to tackle for a long while, but I've been slammed with work.
* <a id="21:36.11">21:36.11 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Also, I'm still pretty low on PHP knowledge.

* <a id="10:23.47">10:23.47 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Is there a way to discover the version of Known from the Settings or Configuration?
* <a id="10:24.02">10:24.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Forget it, I found it.

* <a id="10:38.51">10:38.51 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Oh. There doesn’t seem to be any way for me to get Pierre-O to use that, which I completely understand. So, what are the options for exporting from 0.9.2 and being able to import to another Known site?
* <a id="11:27.33">11:27.33 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: jeremycherfas: probably going to have to massage it by had at this point (probably dump the db on one, import on the other). Stuff in github has had a fair amount of work done on the import/export, so you could wait for the next packaged release, which I gather is set to be out in the next month or so...
* <a id="11:29.16">11:29.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Thanks. I’m still fiddling with managing my own local install of Known, into which I eventually hope to import my existing data. So waiting might not hurt.

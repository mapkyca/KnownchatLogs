* 19:58.40 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: it seems Known last version can be installed on a sub folder on a domain ?
* 19:58.58 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i wonder if there is any details that i need to know regarding nginx conf for subdomain installs
* 19:59.16 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: any idea benwerd, kylewm, mapkyca  ?
* 19:59.32 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: benborges: check out the revised .htaccess rules
* 19:59.42 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: they've been rewritten to support subdomains
* 19:59.49 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: where can i find it ?
* 19:59.53 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I can't speak to what the revised nginx syntax would be
* 19:59.59 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: the htaccess i'm using is from the install

* 20:00.14 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i'v tried both the normal and the 2.4 dist one
* 20:00.33 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: 2.4 seem to be more for Apache host
* 20:00.58 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: weird part is, the first step to install known work perfectly
* 20:01.12 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: it's when you finish the setup, that one get the first nginx error
* 20:01.48 (BST) - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: I don't run nginx and am not in a position to support it, unfortunately. Does it just use the Apache mod_rewrite configuration?
* 20:03.46 (BST) - __[rascul](https://github.com/rascul)__: nginx rewrites are different, there's a converter tool online somewhere though that might work
* 20:04.52 (BST) - __[rascul](https://github.com/rascul)__: http://anilcetin.com/
* 20:05.54 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: wow converting from mod_rewrite to nginx rewrites automatically seems haaaaaard

* 20:50.50 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: anyone have any related experience? It is alllmost as if rewrites are just failing. I ruled that out at one stage but I don’t remember how

* 20:52.19 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: kylewm: everything fell apart when I tried that one
* 20:54.32 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: does /warmup load?  I don't think rewrites are involved in that at all
* 22:09.49 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: nginx rewrites are a little interesting, I've not really tried getting it working. Might have a play tomorrow if I have time...

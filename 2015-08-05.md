* 00:21.21 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: oops, I’m back, sorry - /warmup redirs to /begin, /begin writes Ruh Roh.
* 00:34.19 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: as does anything else that’s not the root of the server
* 00:41.58 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: but everyone has gone to bed and I am sad
* 00:47.19 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: misuba: what did you mean earlier "everything fell apart" when you tried to enable AllowOverride?
* 00:50.17 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: kylewm: I don’t know that it was AllowOverride, but that complete <Directory> block in apache2.conf caused pages to essentially stop serving across the board
* 00:50.31 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: kylewm: I can get more specific results than that in a few minutes
* 00:56.16 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: kylewm: one problem is I’m using a VirtualHost block, not a Directory block
* 00:58.53 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: so, putting that in the Directory block within my site’s VirtualHost block and restarting apache doesn’t change anything
* 01:00.23 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: the issue is the default configuration under Ubuntu, that disallows .htaccess under /var/ww/html
* 01:00.52 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: it's not that yo uneed that block of config, it's that you have to change the one that's already there if it's there
* 01:00.58 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: that affects VirtualHosts?
* 01:01.09 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: no idea
* 01:01.21 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: it probably does if the virtualhost is running out of /var/www/html or a subdirectory
* 01:01.49 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: it isn't
* 01:02.05 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: probably unrelated then
* 01:02.56 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: f it, setting them all to All anyway
* 01:03.14 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: and I’m still getting Ruh Roh
* 01:04.30 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: and did you say you already tried htaccess.dist and htaccess-2.4.dist? (i.e. renaming them to .htaccess)
* 01:05.10 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: I’m on htaccess-2.4.dist now. (as in that’s what I renamed to .htaccess)
* 01:10.29 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: HOLY CRAP i switched to the regular htaccess.dist and now it works fine aaaaaagh
* 01:12.57 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: and I’m definitely running 2.4
* 01:13.06 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: so… there’s that
* 01:20.36 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: it looks like -2.4 was not updated to when the change to support subdirectories happened
* 01:20.55 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: lol, and the last commit comment on -2.4 is " Adding apache 2.4 configuration (can't test because I don't have apache2.4 running anywhere...)"

* 10:56.59 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i have known in a subfolder, nginx was ok to serve the /begin/ of the known install, then when it's over (afte the config.ini part) it lands on nginx 404 error https://ffffff.space/known/begin/
* 13:59.47 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: benborges: as an aside; check your browser caches. I was having a problem where something on nginx/fpm/browser was caching errors, which meant config updates weren't coming through...
* 14:10.30 (BST) - __[norguir](https://github.com/norguir)__: hello - I use Known to post content in 2 languages (English & French). Do you see an easy way (other than 2 instances) to filter all posts in one language or the other?
* 14:21.07 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: There's nothing in the default install that does that specifically, but perhaps one approach would be to use tags - so, if you use #whatever in a post, it'll tag the post with a tag you can then search on, and then you could tag all your english posts with #english and all your french posts similarly. All you'd then have to do is save the search, and maybe link to it.
* 14:21.15 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: obviously this isn't terribly slick
* 14:21.34 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: if you want to get more complicated, you could look at writing a plugin / modifying your theme to streamline this
* 14:25.33 (BST) - __[norguir](https://github.com/norguir)__: mapkyca: thanks - I did think about this option but I fear it could create a mixed up language user experience. I will look into it though. Maybe indeed, adding a few links to the theme as saved search... Thanks again
* 14:28.18 (BST) - __[norguir](https://github.com/norguir)__: while I'm at it: I'm trying to import data from a previous know site. I've copied the database as a first approach and configured the new Known install accordingly. I however seem to loose all images on the way: they point to invalid urls. Any idea?
* 14:31.19 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: if you've changed domains, check the upload directory - uploads are stored per-domain (to support multitenant), so you might need to rename the directory for images to work
* 14:50.40 (BST) - __[norguir](https://github.com/norguir)__: mapkyca: thanks . will look into this.

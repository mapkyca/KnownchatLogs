* 02:48.39 (BST) - __[RamenJunkie](https://github.com/RamenJunkie)__: Is there a way to feed an RSS feed to a Known Site and have them show up as posts?
* 03:04.18 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: RamenJunkie: i don't think so.
* 03:05.19 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: RamenJunkie: I think the best option right now is to use Woodwind https://indiewebcamp.com/Woodwind
* 03:06.11 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: it's a RSS feed reader/writer that lets you reblog, reply, and favorite stuff in your RSS feed to your Known site
* 06:30.59 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: does anyone have a guess as to the next posted-release version of Known? I randomly grabbed the .zip from github a bit ago and think that might have to do with some of the syndication issues I'm experiences
* 06:31.59 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: thought maybe I'd wait until a version was deemed ready to post so I could rule Known out as far as diagnosing these issues
* 16:01.48 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: !tell endi I think "officially" releases are approximately every two weeks, or at least try to be. Though most everyone I know just tracks HEAD for the latest and greatest...

* 17:36.51 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: !tell benwerd I forgot if I mentioned this before, think I did... your package download is http, not tls. You should probably include a sha hash (bonus points, signed sha hash) on the /opensource/ page so people can verify their package before they install it.

* 19:45.42 (BST) - __[sensiblemn](https://github.com/sensiblemn)__: RamenJunkie: actually, i might be mistaken. Maybe Monocle only reads PuSH and not RSS/Atom. It's my understanding that Woodwind does all 3. http://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Indieweb_Reader
* 19:54.55 (BST) - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah Monocle only supports Microformats feeds with PuSH

* <a id="16:11.08">16:11.08 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: hi
* <a id="16:11.18">16:11.18 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i was wondering if there's an rss feed for comments
* <a id="16:11.58">16:11.58 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i realized i don't notice most indieweb mentions, because i don't get any notifications
* <a id="16:12.28">16:12.28 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: for other blogs, i usually just subscribe to the comments feed for that
* <a id="16:24.36">16:24.36 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: Many indieweb sites have a notifications *page* just for that reason, much more like Facebook does, than having to bother with a feed and subscribing and separate app
* <a id="16:25.34">16:25.34 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: e.g. https://indieweb.org/notification#IndieWeb_Examples
* <a id="16:25.39">16:25.39 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: that would make a good feature request for Known
* <a id="17:21.16">17:21.16 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: tantek: thx, but i don't want to have to look at a web page, when all of my other updates come in via a single app
* <a id="17:21.34">17:21.34 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: that's less of a notification and more of a custom feed reader with only one feed
* <a id="17:21.57">17:21.57 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: a simple rss feed would make it possible to just add it to one's reader
* <a id="17:22.13">17:22.13 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: raucao - then an RSS feed of that notifications page would work
* <a id="17:22.50">17:22.50 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: the notifications page is on your own website after all!
* <a id="17:22.54">17:22.54 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: yes, but you wouldn't even need the page for that
* <a id="17:23.07">17:23.07 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i mean, could make sense, but creating a feed doesn't involve theming and all that
* <a id="17:23.11">17:23.11 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: so it's easier to add first
* <a id="17:23.21">17:23.21 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: although i assume it might already exist
* <a id="17:23.35">17:23.35 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: that's not been the experience I've seen - people create the page first because they just want to stay on their site
* <a id="17:23.42">17:23.42 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: and a simple HTML list is no harder than RSS
* <a id="17:23.51">17:23.51 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: it is with known
* <a id="17:23.59">17:23.59 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: because you'd have to integrate it with the themes and all
* <a id="17:24.13">17:24.13 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: interesting
* <a id="17:24.15">17:24.15 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: and all current themes woudl have to add css for it
* <a id="17:24.25">17:24.25 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: well that's worth discussing in a specific issue / feature request
* <a id="17:24.25">17:24.25 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: s/woudl/would
* <a id="17:24.33">17:24.33 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: it could have a very simple default styling
* <a id="17:24.39">17:24.39 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: sure, just asking because the feed might already exist
* <a id="17:24.40">17:24.40 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: that themes could optionally enhance / replace
* <a id="17:25.01">17:25.01 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: I doubt it - the indieweb tools tend to focus on visible pages first, secondary files, well, second
* <a id="17:25.38">17:25.38 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: ok. i'll wait for someone who knows for sure, before opening an issue
* <a id="17:26.10">17:26.10 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: thx
* <a id="17:26.38">17:26.38 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: btw, an rss feed *is* on one's page
* <a id="17:26.51">17:26.51 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: it's just easy to add to a whole bunch of readers that exist and people use
* <a id="17:27.09">17:27.09 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: it's just another representation of the content on the website, but hosted *on* the site, after all
* <a id="17:29.21">17:29.21 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i do like the idea of json feed tho. xml can die in a fire for all i care ;)
* <a id="17:30.21">17:30.21 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: raucao - that's one of the longterm problems with feeds in general, they seem to change formats / preferences every few years (RSS, Atom, now JSON / JSONFeed) etc.
* <a id="17:30.41">17:30.41 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: hence the focus on always creating a visible page equivalent first, for longevity
* <a id="17:30.42">17:30.42 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: last time i checked rss and atom were both alive and well
* <a id="17:31.19">17:31.19 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: sure, people still have compat support, but feeds tend to go out of date with visible content. they're always an additional maintenance task
* <a id="17:31.22">17:31.22 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i have like 250 feeds in my reader, which makes up the majority of my news reading as well as streams for comments, updates, releases, etc.
* <a id="17:31.41">17:31.41 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: Oh I agree that's definitely still a use-case. Just one that is shrinking, especially when Google killed Reader
* <a id="17:32.26">17:32.26 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i completely disagree. google killing reader was the best thing ever. now we have properly maintained alternatives like feedbin and other ones
* <a id="17:32.45">17:32.45 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: i gladly pay for hosted feedbin, but i also know people hosting it themselves
* <a id="17:33.11">17:33.11 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: anyway, it's fairly easy to maintain feeds, and jsonfeed just makes it childplay
* <a id="17:33.15">17:33.15 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: imo
* <a id="17:33.34">17:33.34 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: they're also used across the fediverse and that works quite well
* <a id="18:05.24">18:05.24 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: raucao, Known does have a notifications page hidden in the UI at /account/notifications
* <a id="18:05.29">18:05.29 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: It had a link in previous versions, but it was removed because the UI for it still needs work.
* <a id="18:05.42">18:05.42 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: great, thanks!
* <a id="18:05.46">18:05.46 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: will check it out
* <a id="18:05.54">18:05.54 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I don't think the typical pattern for /?_t=rss will give you an RSS feed for it though.
* <a id="18:05.58">18:05.58 (BST)</a> - __[raucao](https://github.com/raucao)__: running out of juice, need to find power :)
* <a id="18:06.17">18:06.17 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: It's possible that needs to be built in, though there are email notifications as well.
* <a id="18:08.44">18:08.44 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: This might help if you want to uncomment out the hidden portion: https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1757
* <a id="18:11.54">18:11.54 (BST)</a> - __[tantek](https://github.com/tantek)__: [chrisaldrich]++ thanks Chris! I knew someone more knowledgable would know better :)
* <a id="18:11.54">18:11.54 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: chrisaldrich has 1 karma in this channel (42 overall)
* <a id="20:47.28">20:47.28 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I'm interested in potentially working on the notifications page for a future project.
* <a id="20:48.31">20:48.31 (BST)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Idea is to start making actionable webmentions, and I'll likely start by having Known accept webmentions for "invitations" and then be able to create an RSVP in response directly from the notifications page.
* <a id="23:20.41">23:20.41 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn_](https://github.com/sensiblemn_)__: https://freekurt.com/account/notifications isn't very pretty right now. better than nothing, though.
* <a id="23:22.02">23:22.02 (BST)</a> - __[sensiblemn_](https://github.com/sensiblemn_)__: it does seem to trigger browser notifications tho, which is nice

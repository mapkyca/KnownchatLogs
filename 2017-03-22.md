* <a id="17:01.50">17:01.50 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Dgold: You got a minute?
* <a id="17:04.24">17:04.24 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: sure, jeremycherfas, what's up?
* <a id="17:04.57">17:04.57 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I thought I’d have another go at getting your pnut thing working, but doing so on my local installation.
* <a id="17:05.34">17:05.34 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: It enables fine. But as soon as I go to Account, I get an error `Not Found
* <a id="17:05.35">17:05.35 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: The requested URL /pages/account/pnut/ was not found on this server.`
* <a id="17:06.02">17:06.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And yet it worked on my live site — least, I could attempt to put in my authorization.
* <a id="17:06.17">17:06.17 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: okay - so you've enabled the plugin?
* <a id="17:06.32">17:06.32 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yes.
* <a id="17:06.38">17:06.38 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: have you then gone into Settings->Admin->pnut
* <a id="17:06.56">17:06.56 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: But hangon, I went to Diagnostics, and I’m getting an error there that says my local site isn’t HTTPS.
* <a id="17:07.05">17:07.05 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’m sure I haven’t seen that before.
* <a id="17:07.37">17:07.37 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: This is withknown 0.9.2 fairly recent master
* <a id="17:07.53">17:07.53 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I haven't hard-coded https: into the code for pnut anywhere, jeremy, afaia
* <a id="17:08.30">17:08.30 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: No, I don’t think that’s you at all. I am sure it is core.
* <a id="17:08.55">17:08.55 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I could play with it on the live version, except that nobody seems able to tell me how I delete a client from pnut.
* <a id="17:09.03">17:09.03 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I wwant to start again completely from scratch.
* <a id="17:09.28">17:09.28 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I thought that playing locally might be easi8er.
* <a id="17:10.03">17:10.03 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: it should be - what system is the local computer using?
* <a id="17:10.22">17:10.22 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Mac OS. MAMP
* <a id="17:10.38">17:10.38 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: fwiw: I downloaded the git-dev version of known, and installed the pnut plugin maybe a half dozen times
* <a id="17:11.16">17:11.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Did you ever have to delete the client at pnut
* <a id="17:16.54">17:16.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Looks like I need to spring for MAMP 4 Pro to be able to use SSL. At least, I think so.
* <a id="17:40.48">17:40.48 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Strike that.Dgold all worked perfectly this time around.
* <a id="17:47.35">17:47.35 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: \0/
* <a id="17:47.41">17:47.41 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Fantastico!
* <a id="17:47.52">17:47.52 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Did you find out what was wrong?
* <a id="17:51.15">17:51.15 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Nope. Pure voodoo.
* <a id="17:51.41">17:51.41 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Aree you planning to get backfeeds from pnut?
* <a id="17:53.54">17:53.54 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I am!
* <a id="17:54.39">17:54.39 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: working on that atm - mostly (for now) looking over the pnut API and how that could/would feed into Bridgy
* <a id="17:55.29">17:55.29 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So that would be something that gets added to brid.gy?
* <a id="17:56.22">17:56.22 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I was wondering how snarfed does it - so I cna understand the whole backfeed thing
* <a id="17:56.34">17:56.34 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: conceptually, its not something that I'm titally clear on
* <a id="17:57.31">17:57.31 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: it doesn't seem to be something that known is set up for, jeremy, unless I'm completely misreading things
* <a id="17:58.01">17:58.01 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I just read the wiki page on backfeeds, and that gives some hints about overall strategy.
* <a id="17:58.32">17:58.32 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Given that bridgy already knows about Known and seems able to write the comments, that is probably the most efficient way to go.
* <a id="18:00.40">18:00.40 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: problem with hacking on bridgy is that it is *so* wedded into the Google AppEngine ecosystem
* <a id="18:00.59">18:00.59 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: this isn't a criticism, btw, just that for a n00b, its pretty damned daunting
* <a id="18:01.07">18:01.07 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I don’t really know what that means.
* <a id="18:01.50">18:01.50 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: But, looking at the pnut API, there are ways of seeing bookmarks, replies and reposts.
* <a id="18:02.18">18:02.18 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And — ignorance is bliss — that means it ought to be possible to get those and write them back to Known.
* <a id="18:02.37">18:02.37 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: If you’re a noob, I’m a preemie.
* <a id="18:03.45">18:03.45 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: oh, no, I completely agree
* <a id="18:04.01">18:04.01 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: but; and this is the ten-foot-flaming BUT!!
* <a id="18:04.31">18:04.31 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: if you look at Bridgy's code for, say, twitter, it relies on snarfed's granary
* <a id="18:05.08">18:05.08 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: that's (again) a different GoogleAppEngine piece that scrapes html and makes json &c
* <a id="18:05.26">18:05.26 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: so, to get pnut posts -> bridgy -> known
* <a id="18:05.51">18:05.51 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: they have to be scraped by granary -> bridgy -> known
* <a id="18:06.33">18:06.33 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: so, while the API is clear (well, kinda, Robert needs some doc writers) its not just a case of point granary at it & hope
* <a id="18:07.08">18:07.08 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: i was able to rewrite the ADN plugin because it was there, just had to rewrite some stuff
* <a id="18:07.42">18:07.42 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: the heavy lifting was in the photo upload -- which (btw) still throws an error after it's posted the photo to pnut
* <a id="18:07.53">18:07.53 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’m sure you’re right. But it does also seem to be a manageable small thing, if one avoids the granary > brid.gy elements
* <a id="18:07.56">18:07.56 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I can't catch where the redirect error is being thrown
* <a id="18:08.19">18:08.19 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I haven’t tried that yet.
* <a id="18:10.14">18:10.14 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: it posts the image to pnut, it gets the link out of the pnut post, its all _working_
* <a id="18:10.38">18:10.38 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: its just that instead of going back to your main page, it tries to open a photo/edit page instead
* <a id="18:12.00">18:12.00 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Weird.
* <a id="18:13.15">18:13.15 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Looking at granary, snarfed suggests adding a new silo as a valuable activity. Beyond me, I’m sure, but fun to think about.
* <a id="18:17.50">18:17.50 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: speaking of voodoo - just uploaded a pic to pnut, worked absolutely perfectly.
* <a id="18:17.53">18:17.53 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: weirg
* <a id="18:17.56">18:17.56 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: *d
* <a id="18:18.28">18:18.28 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Something must have changed!
* <a id="18:18.33">18:18.33 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Nice looking gin.
* <a id="18:18.56">18:18.56 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Is there a permalink for an individual post to pnut? I’m not seeing one.
* <a id="18:19.36">18:19.36 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yes - when you click the date in Known front page it takes you to the post page
* <a id="18:19.43">18:19.43 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: https://hylozoist.ascraeus.org/2017/found-in-the-local-store---potato-gin
* <a id="18:19.45">18:19.45 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: in that case
* <a id="18:20.05">18:20.05 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: the pnut icon is down the end there after the two twitter handles
* <a id="18:20.33">18:20.33 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Ah no. I want to see what granary makes of a single pnut post.
* <a id="18:20.51">18:20.51 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: oh
* <a id="18:21.09">18:21.09 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: https://pnut.io/@dgold/46796 is the post address
* <a id="18:22.57">18:22.57 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yup. Finally found that. And granary shows almost nothing there. So I suspect it would require getting pnut to do a bunch more markup.
* <a id="18:26.00">18:26.00 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yup
* <a id="18:26.31">18:26.31 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: mind you, everything in pnut is straight json api results anyway
* <a id="18:26.42">18:26.42 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: you can watch pnut using curl or httpie
* <a id="18:29.21">18:29.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: That’ll do for now. Gotta go cook.
* <a id="19:36.27">19:36.27 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Had a great chat with my daughter's school today about leveraging technology to help students, parents, and teachers to connect with each other. I recommended taking a look at Known!

* <a id="10:19.59">10:19.59 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: Is that perception because there aren't regular releases builds?
* <a id="10:24.08">10:24.08 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I dunno... that and I think the mailing list is quite quiet. Plus there was a period of time where folk were busy and the commit process wasn't streamlined, meaning PRs didn't get merged for a while. I think that left some with an impression which has seemingly stuck, even though it hasn't been true for a long while.
* <a id="10:33.46">10:33.46 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: It's remarkable how a wrong impression sticks :D
* <a id="11:37.14">11:37.14 (BST)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: It may partly be because Ben was hugely active to begin with, so as it matures it is going to look like a slow down

* <a id="12:53.34">12:53.34 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Aye, I suspect that has a lot of it. Both Ben and Erin were really active, but now have other plates to keep spinning as well, so outwardly looks like a slowdown even though the reverse is true (for example, I now get paid to work on known)

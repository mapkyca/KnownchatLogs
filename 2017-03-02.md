* <a id="10:09.03">10:09.03 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: just wondering what the json payload would be to trigger syndication to twitter (presuming the twitter plugin is installed)
* <a id="12:05.38">12:05.38 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: yep. basically you send the same parameters in your query as the form - so post to /status/edit to make a status update, activating the appropriate syndication channel. making a get to the same will return a bunch of fields, including the syndication options available. You can watch the post in your browser dev tools to see what variables are being sent...
* <a id="12:05.53">12:05.53 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: see my bash api tool for an example of the signed curl
* <a id="12:57.51">12:57.51 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yeah, I have signed JSON payloads working - that's not the issue
* <a id="12:58.30">12:58.30 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: its the content of the syndicate-to fields I don't have - didn't think to look at browser dev tools - woudn't know where to start
* <a id="13:21.17">13:21.17 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: watch the network tab while making a post, should tell you what you need to know

* <a id="17:32.54">17:32.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Does anyone know, is there any easy way to add an icon to a post to indicate the kind of entry that it is, like photo, or bookmark, or status?
* <a id="17:56.12">17:56.12 (GMT)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: You mean in css, or as an emoji in the post?
* <a id="18:02.44">18:02.44 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Either would do, I suppose. I want something that will be shown in the title so that I can use it in an RSS feed.
* <a id="18:09.44">18:09.44 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: mapkyca: I'm afraid I'm coming up with nothing that works
* <a id="18:09.56">18:09.56 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: the line _appears_ to be :
* <a id="18:10.29">18:10.29 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: "syndicate[]","twitter::_dgoldsmith"
* <a id="18:10.47">18:10.47 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: but encoding that directly in the APItester doesn't syndicate
* <a id="21:00.48">21:00.48 (GMT)</a> - __[[kevinmarks]](https://github.com/[kevinmarks])__: If you want it in the title, then emoji is your best bet

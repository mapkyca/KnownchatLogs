* <a id="13:48.44">13:48.44 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: getting a 502 gateway when trying to export my Known Data admin/export/generate/
* <a id="13:48.56">13:48.56 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: 502 Bad Gateway
* <a id="13:48.56">13:48.56 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: nginx/1.6.2
* <a id="13:49.11">13:49.11 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: wondering what i can do on my side to fix that
* <a id="14:43.22">14:43.22 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: benborges: I was seeing 504 Gateway Timeout using nginx https://github.com/idno/Known/issues/1296
* <a id="14:43.25">14:43.25 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: wonder if it's the same issue
* <a id="14:43.52">14:43.52 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: (which is, I think, that nginx doesn't allow background processing the same way apache does)
* <a id="15:33.42">15:33.42 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: hmmm it ended up my making the backup archive kylewm
* <a id="15:33.52">15:33.52 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and i managed to download it by coming back to the export page
* <a id="15:34.23">15:34.23 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i wonder if some nginx tweaking could solve this, the question is how, i'm not a nginx expert
* <a id="15:36.58">15:36.58 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: it's probably a timeout setting in nginx
* <a id="15:37.09">15:37.09 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: so you could increase the timeout to let nginx run the script longer
* <a id="15:40.18">15:40.18 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: gonna investigate this, thanks all
* <a id="15:52.12">15:52.12 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: in general though, web servers don't like scripts to run for arbitrary lengths of time. it would be better if Known found an alternate way of handling that
* <a id="15:57.06">15:57.06 (GMT)</a> - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: indeed, because i guess the larger the site, at some point it will be impossible to retrieve or to even create the archive
* <a id="15:58.23">15:58.23 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah
* <a id="16:34.23">16:34.23 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: aaronpk: yeah, it's the general shared hosting problem... you can't count on being able to run a background queue, so you have to get creative
* <a id="16:35.07">16:35.07 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah, i'm gonna have to decide if I want to make p3k require a background queue and as such prevent it from working on simple web hosts
* <a id="16:36.50">16:36.50 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: happy medium might be a hacky solution for shared hosts (e.g., wp-cron) that can be swapped out with a background queue
* <a id="16:38.00">16:38.00 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: yeah, it's mostly a question of how many code paths i want to test, especially if i'm not using it myself

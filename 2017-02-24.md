* <a id="14:08.29">14:08.29 (GMT)</a> - __[srcr](https://github.com/srcr)__: I really need some support in migrating my known site from MySQL to Postgres. If anyone can give me some pointers I would appreciate that.
* <a id="17:07.14">17:07.14 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: srcr: gosh... never tried that, I imagine it being non-trivial... however the schemas are *largely* the same. Possibly the easiest would be to write a PHP shell script, pull in the known libraries and write from one to the other at the object level. it'd be a bit of an ugly tango, but should be doable
* <a id="17:34.41">17:34.41 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: oh, the official known Twitter plugin doesn't do a back-link

* <a id="19:24.56">19:24.56 (GMT)</a> - __[srcr](https://github.com/srcr)__: the answer is as simple as piping the export through sed -e 's/\\\\/\\/g'

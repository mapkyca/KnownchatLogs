* <a id="20:50.00">20:50.00 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: hmmm... since upgrading to 0.9.x, my twitter syndication no longer seems to work.
* <a id="20:50.33">20:50.33 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: when I add my twitter account, it claims to have succeeded, but no accounts are listed on the settings page: http://share.cleverdevil.io/Screen-Shot-2016-02-02-12-50-28.png
* <a id="20:51.04">20:51.04 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: twitter syndication toggles *do* show up when I am creating new content, but have no effect.
* <a id="20:53.40">20:53.40 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: *cleverdevil thinks it might just be time to support benwerd_ and crew and sign up for convoy!*
* <a id="20:54.15">20:54.15 (GMT)</a> - __[benwerd_](https://github.com/benwerd_)__: cleverdevil: We would obv love that - but you should also be able to upgrade your Twitter plugin to the very latest version
* <a id="20:54.21">20:54.21 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: OK
* <a id="20:55.23">20:55.23 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: derp, that does indeed appear to be the issue, I am guessing.
* <a id="20:55.28">20:55.28 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: I always forget to update them.
* <a id="20:56.20">20:56.20 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: does Convoy handle syndication and pulling in replies and likes, or do I still leave that up to other services?
* <a id="20:56.29">20:56.29 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: or is it only focused on publishing out?
* <a id="22:08.33">22:08.33 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: cleverdevil: I believe the latter (focused on publishing, still uses Bridgy for pulling stuff back in)
* <a id="22:51.07">22:51.07 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: gotcha, thanks for the clarification kylewm
* <a id="22:51.23">22:51.23 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: yeah, everything is working again, but I definitely think Convoy is a possibility for me soon
* <a id="22:51.32">22:51.32 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: just so I don't have to think about this stuff in the future :)
* <a id="22:51.52">22:51.52 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: that said, it'd be even better if it did what Bridgy does as well.
* <a id="22:52.04">22:52.04 (GMT)</a> - __[cleverdevil](https://github.com/cleverdevil)__: would make it an easier sell from a product perspective.
* <a id="22:52.40">22:52.40 (GMT)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: absolutely

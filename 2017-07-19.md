* <a id="14:13.47">14:13.47 (BST)</a> - __[Eriq](https://github.com/Eriq)__: Hi! I found Known through the Indieweb website, and want to try it out. It said on the known site that a free account could be a good start. When I try to register is says "Known for Education". Does this mean I have to be affiliated to a University or similar to be able to try it out?
* <a id="14:17.50">14:17.50 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Hi Eriq
* <a id="14:18.42">14:18.42 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I‚Äôm not sure, but I think that the hosted free version of Known is no longer available. You have to host it yourself. It is quite easy to do. I have my instance hosted on Dreamhost, and it wasn‚Äôt difficult.
* <a id="15:52.40">15:52.40 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Eriq, I think that jeremycherfas is right and that the free hosted version is no longer offered.
* <a id="15:52.41">15:52.41 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: If you don't want to self-host, I do believe that Known does still offer a paid hosted version though if you fill out their form.
* <a id="15:53.06">15:53.06 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I also think that places like Reclaim hosting offer one-click installs if you don't want to get your hands dirty too.
* <a id="16:15.47">16:15.47 (BST)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: sounds like there might be some indieweb.org wiki pages to update
* <a id="16:20.39">16:20.39 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Search on wiki finds no results for Known, but search for withknown goes to http://indieweb.org/withknown which is Redirected from Withknown.
* <a id="16:51.39">16:51.39 (BST)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: [chrisaldrich] last I checked Known has 2 easy guides for setting it up for selfhosting https://withknown.com/guides/ (one on Arvixe, one on Reclaim) but they only host for ‚Äúgroups‚Äù and education. For non-education you have to contact them separately through https://withknown.com/contact/ (no standard form)
* <a id="17:11.31">17:11.31 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I've fired off an email to Erin Jo et al. to see how they'd like to best handle these cases and to see how we can direct individuals.
* <a id="17:11.44">17:11.44 (BST)</a> - __[Eriq](https://github.com/Eriq)__: Thanks for the reply, @jeremycherfas! I will look into that option. I currently have my site at a swedish host, perhaps it's possible to have Known there as well.
* <a id="17:12.31">17:12.31 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: jeremycherfas did DreamHost have a one-click set up option? Or did you do it all manually?
* <a id="17:12.32">17:12.32 (BST)</a> - __[Eriq](https://github.com/Eriq)__: Thank you for that, @chrisaldrich!
* <a id="17:13.24">17:13.24 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: No problem Eriq, it's a common enough question and we should all have some better/simpler options.
* <a id="17:13.33">17:13.33 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I did it manually, but thew fact that I managed it, on a sub-domain of an existing domain, means it really is easy.
* <a id="17:14.51">17:14.51 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: !tell eriq You‚Äôre welcome
* <a id="17:14.51">17:14.51 (BST)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: Ok, I'll tell them that when I see them next
* <a id="17:15.24">17:15.24 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: jeremycherfas I think you should give yourself more credit as a developer than you do. üôÇ

* <a id="18:35.01">18:35.01 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: It looks like it's not finding webmention targets to some extent. Additionally if you click on the timestamp link on Brid.gy, it'll give you some log information about what happened (or not). Eg: https://brid.gy/log?start_time=1526506363&key=aglzfmJyaWQtZ3lyNQsSCFJlc3BvbnNlIid0YWc6dHdpdHRlci5jb20sMjAxMzo5OTY4NjI0MjUwMjk3NTQ4ODAM

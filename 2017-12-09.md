* <a id="13:32.07">13:32.07 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: hi all, i'm migrating my Known site to a subdomain. cPanel wouldn't let me clone it so I had to install a new instance and then import my content from an rss export from the old site.
* <a id="13:33.19">13:33.19 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Problem is that there wasn't a Known import in version 0.9.2 so i stupidly used the WP import instead. this has meant all status posts are duplicated in their titles: see https://stream.raretrack.uk/
* <a id="13:34.35">13:34.35 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: i've now upgraded to 0.9.9. and see there is a now a Known import facility. Is there any way I can delete my first bulk import of content so i can start afresh, or will i need to start the install over again?!
* <a id="13:34.52">13:34.52 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: couldn‚Äôt you point the new Known instance at the old database?
* <a id="13:35.33">13:35.33 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: yeah i tried to do that, but cPanel wouldn't let me on install. guess i could try repointing it now? can't do any harm
* <a id="13:36.17">13:36.17 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Are you installing known through cPanel? (Sorry, I haven‚Äôt worked with cPanel in years.)
* <a id="13:36.54">13:36.54 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: yes i am, though I did the upgrade manually via import zip / extract in cPanel's file manager
* <a id="13:45.18">13:45.18 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: that's weird, i've pointed cPanel at the old database which is now reflected in settings, but it's still using the new one as the data is still wrong. i know the old database is fine because the original instance is still working at https://raretrack.uk/
* <a id="13:48.27">13:48.27 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Is there any caching you have to empty in Known?
* <a id="13:50.31">13:50.31 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Otherwise, if you want to go around cPanel, there should be a config INI file somewhere (as detailed here http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/config/) that is telling Known at what Database is should be looking. You can double check if that file is correct.
* <a id="13:54.55">13:54.55 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: brilliant, editing the config.ini file has done the trick - and saved me an hour at least too :)
* <a id="13:55.09">13:55.09 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Zegnat++
* <a id="13:55.09">13:55.09 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: zegnat has 1 karma in this channel (156 overall)
* <a id="13:56.18">13:56.18 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Nice! It sounded weird that you would have to do entire imports and exports. You might have to run some update script if your new Known instance is a newer version from the old one though, in case the database structure has been updated (I haven‚Äôt kept up with db updates and don‚Äôt know)
* <a id="13:57.52">13:57.52 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: from reading the version change the db updates were all in the previous version, so fingers crossed should be ok
* <a id="14:06.27">14:06.27 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: üëç Glad I could help then
* <a id="14:15.16">14:15.16 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: now i just need to work out how to do redirect of the RSS feeds
* <a id="14:52.19">14:52.19 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I don't normally post photos to WithKnown from my desktop, and when I do, I invariably get an error "No file was uploaded". But it was, and I can use it in an ordinary post. No idea how to fix this.
* <a id="14:55.58">14:55.58 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: i spoke too soon about my relocated Known instance. it's now throwing up database errors - cPanel and config.ini are setup correctly pointing to the right database + password. Think I am going to start again with a completely fresh install!
* <a id="14:58.11">14:58.11 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: are you on 0.9.9 Jeremy?
* <a id="14:58.59">14:58.59 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: No. I went back to 0.9.2 because 0.9.9 was not working for me with micro.blog
* <a id="15:00.18">15:00.18 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: handily i'm just about to go back to a completely fresh 0.9.2 and then 0.9.9 - i'll try posting a photo from each if that would help eliminate what it might be?
* <a id="15:02.01">15:02.01 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: It might; but I wish the error messaging were a little more informative.
* <a id="15:02.54">15:02.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Interesting. Just checked micro and the photo I attached by hand to a post, rather than a photo, came over fine.
* <a id="15:05.18">15:05.18 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I went through the config dance a few weeks ago and I did get it to work, in the end,. Alas, I didn't document it terribly well.
* <a id="15:07.48">15:07.48 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: first photo test gone ok - https://stream.raretrack.uk/2017/test-post---photo-from-v092
* <a id="15:07.50">15:07.50 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: [Rob Fairhead] Test post - photo from v0.9.2
* <a id="15:07.50">15:07.50 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: https://stream.raretrack.uk/file/4ad9362531cf3c2cd7515c3bceb2961e/logo_beta.png
* <a id="15:10.46">15:10.46 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: 0.9.9 photo test fine too - not sure it helps you much though
* <a id="15:13.50">15:13.50 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So, those were uploading from your desktop?
* <a id="15:14.38">15:14.38 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: yes, i'd saved the photo on my laptop
* <a id="15:15.47">15:15.47 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Well, I'm happy for you ...
* <a id="15:23.45">15:23.45 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: oh my, having gone to all this trouble the Known import has failed. have tried today's, yesterday's and older ones. Hmm, looks like back to the WP duplicate import and then manually editing the duplications out :)
* <a id="15:29.49">15:29.49 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Oh no.
* <a id="15:32.18">15:32.18 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: "Sorry, your data import was unsuccessful.It looks like some or all of the data you provided could not be imported. You could try the import again, or ask your system administrator for help!"
* <a id="15:33.04">15:33.04 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: When I was trying to import from a previous install, which was 0.9.2 and over which I had no control, the Known import failed over and over again.
* <a id="15:34.10">15:34.10 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Sounds like the same thing.
* <a id="15:35.36">15:35.36 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I gave up in the end, although I still have the download in case I can ever get to grips with it.
* <a id="15:36.22">15:36.22 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: Annoyingly, as I've had to import them all as posts (rather than statuses), even when I clear the title it still shows as 'Untitled'. I think I am just going to live with the old posts being like that - I don't really want to edit 3 years of content!
* <a id="15:36.53">15:36.53 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: at least the migration is complete :)
* <a id="15:38.02">15:38.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Understood!
* <a id="17:01.01">17:01.01 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: hmm just noticed that only being import my old Known stream as articles means that I have lost the actual link in the all the articles I've bookmarked over the last 3 years - this is really frustrating as I've curated loads of links to myself.
* <a id="17:05.33">17:05.33 (GMT)</a> - __[raretrack](https://github.com/raretrack)__: OMG it's even worse than i thought - *all* links have gone, e.g. I replied to URL on x's site, x replied to me on my site, etc.!

* <a id="14:03.06">14:03.06 (GMT)</a> - __[plindner](https://github.com/plindner)__: jgmac1106: I'd like to see a way to do proper backdating in the UI.  It should be doable via micropub, but Quill doesn't support it.  The best I could do was to create a post in Wordpress, backdate, export and then import into Known.  Kindof painful.

We added more security and now only allow access to the database from three specific IP addresses
* <a id="15:51.50">15:51.50 (GMT)</a> - __[aaronpk](https://github.com/aaronpk)__: plindner: I could add a published date field to Quill very easily if that'd be useful
* <a id="15:51.50">15:51.50 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: aaronpk: mapkyca left you a message 2 weeks, 1 day ago: re micropub, not sure what the current status is... but I see there are a few tickets for it in the tracker so I'm guessing there are a few issues with it. I've not had any time get into it...
* <a id="15:57.57">15:57.57 (GMT)</a> - __[jgmac1106](https://github.com/jgmac1106)__: thanks aaronpk what I am trying to do is add a bunch of posts I have published on medium and elsewhere: https://medium.com/@jgmac1106/stepping-towards-the-future-cd42f11bf2db#.9jebhj3cj to blog.reviewtalentfeedback.com with the OG publication dates.
* <a id="15:59.00">15:59.00 (GMT)</a> - __[jgmac1106](https://github.com/jgmac1106)__: I saw the custom scripts on the github issues, but don't have time to handle it myself with semester starting next week. Trying to wrap up umpteen million tutorials before I get busy at the jobby jon and dont have time for the hobby job
* <a id="15:59.32">15:59.32 (GMT)</a> - __[jgmac1106](https://github.com/jgmac1106)__: jobby job* hate when spelling mistakes ruin a good rhyme

Will be in San Fran in summer though (hopefully depending on priorities

* <a id="17:49.41">17:49.41 (GMT)</a> - __[plindner](https://github.com/plindner)__: aaronpk: more control over the posting process would be most appreciated.  Here's another idea: micropub posting proxy.
* <a id="17:49.56">17:49.56 (GMT)</a> - __[plindner](https://github.com/plindner)__: Idea is to submit your post to the proxy which encapsulates biz logic on where to post, when to post, and potentially mutate the data before posting.
* <a id="17:51.07">17:51.07 (GMT)</a> - __[plindner](https://github.com/plindner)__: Simple examples:  a draft-post proxy for sites that don't support drafts.  Posting embargo (post after an explicit time or event). etc.

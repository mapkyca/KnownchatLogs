* <a id="13:56.19">13:56.19 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Managed to set Known up in a subdomain of my main site, and I have a question. I have a Lets Encrypt certificate on the sub-domain and on the domain, and Known is telling me that there is no certificate. Should I get rid of the one on the sub-domain?
* <a id="15:59.37">15:59.37 (GMT)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: I set up a le cert on the sub domain also, Jeremy, with no issues.

* <a id="16:24.54">16:24.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Well that's pretty weird. It seems that I was logged in to my Known site via http rather than https. When I deliberately specified https I was presented with a fresh login, and now the installation reports no problems.
* <a id="16:24.55">16:24.55 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So I think that's my problem solved.

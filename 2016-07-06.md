The channel is pretty quiet right now, so I thought I'd say hello, and ping some people (like benwerd, mapkyca, and kylewm) that you're here.  If no one responds for a while, try posting on our development mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev or just try coming back later.
* <a id="13:45.24">13:45.24 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: Hello, I'm looking into installing known on my own. The thing I can't handle my self is how to make rewrite rules to work for lighttpd. Is here someone who is running known with lighttpd please?
* <a id="14:08.27">14:08.27 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: pvagner, not that I know of, I'm using Nginx
* <a id="14:09.27">14:09.27 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: i dont see any mention of it in the doc neither : http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/instructions/
* <a id="15:45.12">15:45.12 (BST)</a> - __[pvagner](https://github.com/pvagner)__: rMdes: Can you at least better understand these rules than me? I would try converting them manually either from nginks example config or apache .htaccess. I do have difficulties understanding what the redirects pointing to the css and js folders and the files inside are supposed to do.
* <a id="15:47.02">15:47.02 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: hmm I don't understand this part enough to explain how it works to you...maybe tommorris ? or try later mapkyca or kylewm
* <a id="15:47.42">15:47.42 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: pvagner, up to now I only installed Known on nginx or apache setup
* <a id="15:48.44">15:48.44 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: but I'm far from an expert on that part of the install, try maybe "bear" on the #indieweb channel
* <a id="16:13.47">16:13.47 (BST)</a> - __[tommorris](https://github.com/tommorris)__: rMdes: I'm not a known user. I just lurk in here.
* <a id="16:19.50">16:19.50 (BST)</a> - __[rMdes](https://github.com/rMdes)__: hmm ok sorry

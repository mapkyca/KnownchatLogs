* <a id="09:32.54">09:32.54 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: bore da
* <a id="09:38.17">09:38.17 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: You’re Welsh?
* <a id="09:39.58">09:39.58 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: heh heh! na, just have some welsh friends and go climing in Wales quite often ;)
* <a id="09:41.21">09:41.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Sufficient reason.
* <a id="10:03.46">10:03.46 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Mapkyca: If I opt to clone the idno repo onto my server, would I add the the Uploads foler and config.ini to .gitignore?
* <a id="10:06.35">10:06.35 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: .gitignore only affects things if you're commiting to the repo - just keep a backup of your upload directory and config.ini, just in case. A backup of your database wouldn't hurt either. Other than those precautions it's fairly safe - all my known sites are direct checkouts from git.
* <a id="10:07.13">10:07.13 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OK. I don’t think I’ll be committing anything!
* <a id="10:24.42">10:24.42 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: go on, jeremy, take the plunge!
* <a id="10:24.48">10:24.48 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: update all of the things :)
* <a id="10:32.21">10:32.21 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: dgold: I’m in the middle of updating via SFTP and it is taking forever, which is why I was thinking about just doing it with GIT.
* <a id="10:32.35">10:32.35 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: On the last stretch now.
* <a id="10:34.11">10:34.11 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: ick, no fan of sftp
* <a id="10:34.44">10:34.44 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: *dgold has found rsync to be better*
* <a id="10:35.14">10:35.14 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I get a bit nervous with rsync.
* <a id="10:35.49">10:35.49 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Weird — About still shows version 0.9.2
* <a id="10:37.10">10:37.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: just let me check mine
* <a id="10:37.25">10:37.25 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yup - same
* <a id="10:38.05">10:38.05 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: But that’s the latest stable package.
* <a id="10:38.33">10:38.33 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: probably just not bumped the ver in the git repo
* <a id="10:38.47">10:38.47 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And Quill still fails to find the syndication targets. Need to investigate further.
* <a id="10:41.06">10:41.06 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: hit 'refresh list' on quill
* <a id="10:41.29">10:41.29 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I did that. Nada.
* <a id="10:41.56">10:41.56 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: And test 601 at micropub.rocks still fails
* <a id="10:41.58">10:41.58 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: ok - when I refresh, I see my three configured endpoints
* <a id="10:42.13">10:42.13 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: do you have root access to your server?
* <a id="10:42.20">10:42.20 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: root/shell
* <a id="10:42.42">10:42.42 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yes.
* <a id="10:42.59">10:42.59 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: When you say configued endpoints, where did you configure?
* <a id="10:44.10">10:44.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: ok - as follows:
* <a id="10:44.16">10:44.16 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Quill shows me my profile and my micropub endpoints and my access token but Refresh syndicate does nothing
* <a id="10:44.27">10:44.27 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: First Installed & Activated the IndieSyndicate Known Plugin
* <a id="10:44.56">10:44.56 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Site Configuration -> Plugins
* <a id="10:45.12">10:45.12 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Ah. Maybe that’s it. I have IndiePub but not IndieSyndicate.
* <a id="10:45.26">10:45.26 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Then I set up Synidcation Endpoints in Account Settings -> IndieSyndicate
* <a id="10:46.25">10:46.25 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: Then (separately) I installed the Twitter Plugin (not linked from the Known DOcs) and linked that to a Twitter account
* <a id="10:47.00">10:47.00 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: and now that also shows up as an Endpoint in Quill
* <a id="10:48.40">10:48.40 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Let me look for that.
* <a id="10:48.49">10:48.49 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OK, Got that, now will configure
* <a id="10:49.52">10:49.52 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: dgold - that was on master rather than 0.9.2? Indiesyndicate has been erroring out for me on 0.9.2.
* <a id="10:49.53">10:49.53 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Rats! Fatal error.
* <a id="10:50.43">10:50.43 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Jaduncan: My version says 0.9.2 but I just downloaded the master
* <a id="10:53.51">10:53.51 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I see the problem. Because I just downloaded the zip of indiesyndication I didn’t get at least one of the externals required.
* <a id="10:54.28">10:54.28 (GMT)</a> - __[jaduncan[m]](https://github.com/jaduncan[m])__: jeremycherfas: Ah. And you got an error something like this?

* <a id="11:00.36">11:00.36 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Dgold: how did you install IndieSyndicate
* <a id="11:03.03">11:03.03 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: git clone'd the IS repo into IdnoPlugins
* <a id="11:03.46">11:03.46 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: git clone --recursive https://github.com/kylewm/KnownIndieSyndicate.git IndieSyndicate
* <a id="11:05.40">11:05.40 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Yup. Going to do that. Thanks.
* <a id="11:20.02">11:20.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Dgold: I get an error of “Endpoint does not appear to support Micropub or Webmention:” when I attempt to add Twitter as my syndication target. So I’m confused as heck. What is the target? Is it Quill, or Twitter?
* <a id="11:37.03">11:37.03 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: OK, I used silo.pub and at least that seems to have been accepted. Now to see about Quill.
* <a id="11:41.23">11:41.23 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: sorry, was afk
* <a id="11:41.48">11:41.48 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yes - the endpoint is your syndicate-to service, e.g. silo.pub or twitter &c
* <a id="11:42.41">11:42.41 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Managed to get silo to syndicate — but that’s no advance on the Twitter plugin. And Quill still cannot find the endpoint.
* <a id="11:44.01">11:44.01 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: 'no advance on the twitter pluign' - what do you mean?
* <a id="11:45.15">11:45.15 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: tbh, I think at this point you'd be best to take your backup config.ini and your Uploads/, and do a fresh install, then re-implement the plugins one by one until you have what you want.
* <a id="11:45.47">11:45.47 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: it seems that something has gotten broken - if you've set up a silo.pub endpoint, then quill should see that as an endpoint
* <a id="11:46.36">11:46.36 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I mean that the Twitter plugin was enabling me to syndicate to Twitter. I was hoping to be able to syndicate to Twitter directly from Quill.
* <a id="11:51.02">11:51.02 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: It does honestly seem to me that there are so many moving parts, and as a result so many things potentially to stop moving, that it is really hard to get my head around. I think some really clear diagrams or animations would be very useful. Maybe that’s something I can contribute.
* <a id="11:51.44">11:51.44 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: jeremycherfas: I've syndicated directly to tiwwter from quill
* <a id="11:53.00">11:53.00 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yup - just did it again
* <a id="11:53.21">11:53.21 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: https://headcrash.ascraeus.org/2017/quick-test-for-syndic -- that was done entirely from quill
* <a id="11:53.28">11:53.28 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: That’s great. It means that Quill can find your syndication targets. But it cannot seem to find mine, even after adding IndieSyndicate
* <a id="11:54.10">11:54.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: that's what I mean - i think(fear) there's something borked in your installation
* <a id="11:55.45">11:55.45 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: So you’re suggesting I go back to square one and activate one plugin at a time, just like the good old days with WP. Mybe I should. But not today.
* <a id="11:55.54">11:55.54 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I’m already behind with my “work”
* <a id="12:07.02">12:07.02 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: coolio
* <a id="12:13.45">12:13.45 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Perhaps while I’m about it I’ll clone the idno repo rather than faff around with FTP. But, like I say, not today.
* <a id="19:36.52">19:36.52 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: importing an entire hugo blog to known -- did not go well

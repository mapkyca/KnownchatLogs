* <a id="09:19.44">09:19.44 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Morning
* <a id="09:19.51">09:19.51 (GMT)</a> - __[Loqi](https://github.com/Loqi)__: good morning
* <a id="15:34.12">15:34.12 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: hey
* <a id="15:34.33">15:34.33 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I'm tearing my hair out with known/php's json encoding
* <a id="15:40.20">15:40.20 (GMT)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I wish I could help you, but json is a closed book to me.
* <a id="15:44.42">15:44.42 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: dgold: what's the issue?
* <a id="15:55.31">15:55.31 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: mapycka - trying to get image posts syndicated to an external API
* <a id="15:55.57">15:55.57 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: in this case pnut - it isn't helped by the paucity of pnut documentation :(
* <a id="15:56.14">15:56.14 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: If I could see what known is sending, I might have some hope
* <a id="15:56.46">15:56.46 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: mapkyca: Oh, I'm using your KnownAppNet plugin, rewritten to use pnut's API endpoints

* <a id="16:12.47">16:12.47 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: is it the client -> known you're trying to debug, or the known -> pnut connection? When I debug syndication channels I tend to hardcode the endpoint url to a pastebin url... then at least you can see what it's sending
* <a id="16:23.19">16:23.19 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: known->pnut
* <a id="16:23.20">16:23.20 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: s/postbin/requestbin
* <a id="16:23.35">16:23.35 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: ah, I never thought of doing that
* <a id="16:24.10">16:24.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: you don't have that in a gist or something, do you mapkyca ?
* <a id="16:28.45">16:28.45 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: The output? No... but the endpoint url is set by a single variable, so should be fairly straightforward to change and fire your request
* <a id="16:31.56">16:31.56 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: yeah, I've written that up :)
* <a id="16:32.10">16:32.10 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: thanks mapkyca. I'd not heard of this site before today
* <a id="16:52.39">16:52.39 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: glad to help :)
* <a id="18:08.26">18:08.26 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: hmmm. can't get anything to post to requestbin using known's internal proc call
* <a id="18:08.38">18:08.38 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I think I may be seeing just what I've done here
* <a id="18:50.00">18:50.00 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Question: any reason that you can "reply to a site" on a "Status update" but not a "Post"?
* <a id="19:38.16">19:38.16 (GMT)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: i wish I knew what you meant by that, [cleverdevil]
* <a id="20:31.22">20:31.22 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: cleverdevil I think that technically you can reply in a Post by just including the URL in the body of the post and that will send a webmention when it's published. The semantic difference may be between the receiving site showing it as a "reply" versus a "mention" based on the microformat class that was sent on the post.
* <a id="20:35.04">20:35.04 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: As an example, I don't think that replies to WordPress sites this way always differentiate very well and so they oftentimes show up as mentions by default rather than specifically as replies.
* <a id="20:35.27">20:35.27 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I find myself getting a lot of incoming webmentions on WordPress which indicate "X mentioned this on example.com" and manually changing semantic_linkbacks_type from mention to reply (and also stripping off "webmention" from comment_type) so that it' will display the originating site the way I think it should.
* <a id="20:35.55">20:35.55 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: This is a known bug (?) on the wordpress side and may be tweaked in the near future.
* <a id="21:01.32">21:01.32 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I mean that "status update" asks explicitly for a URL to reply to: http://share.cleverdevil.io/yhv2EzrSpw.png
* <a id="21:01.37">21:01.37 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Whereas "New Post" does not.
* <a id="21:01.55">21:01.55 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: I also like how the post is rendered when you reply to a site. It actually says "In response to ..."
* <a id="21:06.08">21:06.08 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I think I understand what you mean and I've always viewed it as a simple quirk. I suspect that some of it was the parallelism they wanted between new status update, reply, bookmark, (and if you have KnownReactions installed, likes and reposts). Status updates don't allow adding raw HTML though, while New Posts do if I remember correctly.
* <a id="21:07.02">21:07.02 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: If you can't include raw html and therefore permalinks of URLs, the reply to post part is there so your status update can send a webmention.
* <a id="21:09.46">21:09.46 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: Some of the difference is in the length of what constitutes a /note versus an /article. The rest is probably having a simple way of allowing users to input their content, but still easily allowing webmentions to be sent "properly".
* <a id="21:11.36">21:11.36 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: The more subtle difference is probably between status update and reply, but in that case it's likely just a small difference in the microformats classes that get put on one versus the other.
* <a id="21:16.45">21:16.45 (GMT)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: You'll also notice they don't have primary "reply" post type in the UI. So there's also a small UI difference in sending replies versus shares if you come to the UI from their bookmarklet. As an example try using: http://cleverdevil.io/share?share_url=http%3A%2F%2Fboffosocko.com%2F&share_title=Chris%20Aldrich%20%7C%20Musings%20of%20a%20Modern%20Day%20Cyberneticist
* <a id="22:09.44">22:09.44 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Gotcha, thanks for the clarification chrisaldrich
* <a id="22:09.44">22:09.44 (GMT)</a> - __[[cleverdevil]](https://github.com/[cleverdevil])__: Personally, I'd still like it if it were consistent across all of the post types.

* 09:58.26 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: @mapkyca so, I setup another RPi, setup new instance of MySQL, swapped /var/lib/mysql with the directory from my borked RPi, started mysqld_safe and was even able to list 'knowndb' and use knowndb
* 09:59.15 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: but, when I attempt to 'show tables;' I get "Can't read dir of './knowndb/' (errno: 13) :(
* 10:00.11 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: I think my posts are gone :-\
* 10:09.29 (BST) - __[endi](https://github.com/endi)__: I guess I will retire the old server's microSD card since I can't really trust it anymore anyway. maybe someday I'll run into a MySQL guru and see if they have any advice. I think there's a Linux Users Group this week I'll bring it up there.
* 11:26.18 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: endi: Sorry to hear that. Double check that the physical directory, and all the files inside are owned by mysql - i.e. chown -R mysql:mysql, as errno 13 usually means that the physical table files couldn't be read.
* 11:27.34 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: and yes, probably best to retire that sd card. I love the RPi, and have a bunch, but I do think that the SD card is the weak link, and I've had a fair amount suffer from infant mortality due to them :/
* 11:28.45 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: makes sense since they were designed for storage rather than running an os off, and there is a limit to how many write/delete cycles each bit can go through
* 11:30.19 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: this is a high number, but it could easily occur if you use it for an os drive... there's some anecdotal evidence to suggest that turning off logging / logging to an external syslog server can extend the life, but I've not put that to the test myself
* 13:18.46 (BST) - __[endi_](https://github.com/endi_)__: @mapkyca hmm I will check on those permissions. i know mysql and everything inside was owned by mysql:mysql, but I didn't dig deeper into say the 'knowndb' folder
* 13:19.31 (BST) - __[endi_](https://github.com/endi_)__: @mapkyca yeah, microSD in the RPi B+ and now RPi 2 I've found to perform worse than the full sized in the B
* 13:20.51 (BST) - __[endi_](https://github.com/endi_)__: perhaps there is less excess space to facilitate extension of life via wear leveling -- although I believe this event was caused by a power outage
* 13:21.57 (BST) - __[endi_](https://github.com/endi_)__: LG and TMobile just sent me a 128GB microSD as part of my phone purchase.. I'm slightly terrified to trust that with anything tbh
* 13:22.48 (BST) - __[endi_](https://github.com/endi_)__: I will use it to record 4K video to play around but I don't know if I'd leave that in full time. I typically send all photos/videos to SD storage on my phones
* 13:47.13 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: endi_ : you may also have better luck with the sqlite engine... it's experimental, so obvs. don't bet the farm on it, but it's a regular file so backups should be easier, and you don't need to keep a db server running.
* 15:42.53 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: hello everyone
* 15:43.15 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i keep having my known behaving weirdly without being able to pin point the issue
* 15:43.41 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: my latest is not being able to browse backward https://1-m.cc/content/all/?offset=10
* 15:44.15 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: make me think about the other javascript problem i'm having with all the POSSE plugins
* 15:45.10 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: if you have any idea, this is a fresh known install, where the POSSE plugins have been installed from git
* 15:45.26 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i have a second known install on another domain working just fine
* 15:48.36 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: this seems like a url rewrite issue to me... like it is stripping the ?offset=10 param before it gets to the server code
* 15:50.28 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: you are running nginx right? can you share your config for the 1-m.cc site?
* 16:17.12 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: yes 2 sec
* 16:22.56 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: kylewm, https://yuno.1-m.cc/pad/p/DebugKnown
* 16:23.58 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i might have also my TLS settings to tight
* 16:24.13 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: maybe this does not help communication between servers
* 16:24.28 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and end up rejected by my browser
* 16:24.36 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: hence the weird behaviors ?
* 16:27.05 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: id' think you see lots of noisy error messages if that were the case :/
* 16:32.31 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: hmm
* 16:32.39 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: look at this video kylewm  http://youtu.be/v523WoTMKfk
* 16:32.45 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: this is how it behave
* 16:33.26 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: kylewm, hmm just wait 5 minutes, sorry, still doing it's thing
* 16:34.00 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: basically it me show adding a POSSE plugin, IRC in this case, then remove the "channel"
* 16:34.08 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and try to do the same with linkedin
* 16:34.14 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and can't remove the connection
* 16:34.22 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: or connect a new one by the way
* 16:35.07 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: same with bridgy, i connect my accounts with bridgy but buttons dont turn gray showing they are connected already (like in my other known install )
* 16:35.19 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: benborges: i made a change to your etherpad - s/index.php/index.php?$query_string
* 16:35.21 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: try that
* 16:36.57 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: kylewm, thanks :))))))PD
* 16:37.08 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: next/previous page seem to be fixed
* 16:37.20 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: let's see if that was also messing with other buttons
* 16:37.43 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: fingers crossed...
* 16:38.24 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: linkedin unable to disconnect, bridgy buttons dont change state,
* 16:38.41 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: going to try twitter connecitng it first time and adding an account
* 16:42.56 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: facebook : http://youtu.be/ayowo1Zgkl8
* 16:51.46 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: hmm bad me
* 16:51.51 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: forgot to reload nginx
* 16:52.06 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: now with the modification kylewm i just connected facebook
* 16:54.38 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh, that seems promising!
* 16:56.11 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: still can't disconnect linkedin
* 16:56.37 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: but facebook connect and disconect fine
* 16:57.25 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: interesting
* 17:01.19 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i wish i could edit the database directly
* 17:01.23 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and disconnect linkedin
* 17:01.27 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: from there
* 17:01.37 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: is that even possible kylewm
* 17:01.38 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: ?
* 17:01.56 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: yeah absolutely
* 17:02.09 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: good news: brigdy works fine now buttons show it is connected
* 17:02.18 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: i mean, I don't know about the linkedin plugin, but you should be able to edit the database manually
* 17:03.09 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: maybe mapkyca knows more about this
* 17:03.32 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: contrary to my other known install, there isn't even a name connected to it
* 17:03.50 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i just have (Disconnect)
* 17:04.24 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: instead of Ben Borges (Disconnect)
* 17:06.20 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: I think it's probably in a bad state where it thinks it's connected but it isn't really
* 17:06.25 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: so disconnect doesn't work
* 17:06.59 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: so manually removing the linked in config from your user in the database may work...
* 17:14.01 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: that's the idea
* 17:27.03 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: ok i guess it's definitely good, for twitter, facebook
* 17:27.26 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: now i just need to figure out how to edit database t disconnect this plugin manually
* 17:28.41 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: if you can get to the mysql command line, you can do: select uuid,contents from entities where entity_subtype='Idno\\Entities\\User';
* 17:29.12 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: and then update entities set contents='{edited contents}' where uuid='the uuid returned by the first query'
* 17:29.35 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: i don't know how facile you are with SQL :p
* 17:31.42 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: not at all
* 17:32.20 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i don't use phpmyadmin neither
* 17:32.25 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: but i have news
* 17:32.28 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: since the nginx fix
* 17:32.38 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i tried to connect a "new account" to linkedin plugin
* 17:32.41 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and it works
* 17:32.51 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: oh good point, phpmyadmin would be much easier...
* 17:32.52 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: now i have my account connected, and a second (disconnect) button
* 17:33.07 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: ha, progress!
* 17:33.11 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: but when i go to post a status, i only see one, (the correct one)
* 17:33.18 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: so actually much progress
* 17:33.35 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: i'm POSSING ok to L/T/F
* 17:33.53 (BST) - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: \o/
* 17:33.55 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: but that prove in a way that there is a remain of "something" in the database
* 17:34.38 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: regarding the linkedin button, now, i can also go along with this, but i guess it would be better for Known to know why is this 'remain connection without user' there
* 17:36.46 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: my post screen is now like this : https://i.imgur.com/EiYrThtl.jpg
* 17:37.35 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: and min setting/linkedin : http://i.imgur.com/wFZDpWQ.png
* 18:07.55 (BST) - __[benborges](https://github.com/benborges)__: posted issues on github
* 18:22.00 (BST) - __[misuba](https://github.com/misuba)__: I notice that when you view a post that’s members only and then sign out, you get served a 410 Gone page. That seems… a little funny?
* 20:10.12 (BST) - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: misuba: that's because you no longer have access to pull the object out of the db, so it's as if it doesn't exist. I know, strictly speaking, you should return 403 or something, but the recommended secure approach is to not return any information - i.e. returning a 403 would inform an attacker that there was something there, potentially revealing information in the url line. Best to return 404 or 410.

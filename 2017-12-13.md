* <a id="02:54.17">02:54.17 (GMT)</a> - __[j12t](https://github.com/j12t)__: Hi everybody, I'm writing a tutorial on https://indieweb.org/Tutorials for how to set up an Indie Website with Known on Amazon EC2. I would love to have some input what the "optimal" configuration is, if there is such a thing.

* <a id="02:55.22">02:55.22 (GMT)</a> - __[j12t](https://github.com/j12t)__: I already created a full tutorial for Wordpress plus IndieWeb plugins:https://indieweb.org/Tutorial:_Set_up_an_IndieWebSite_using_WordPress_on_the_Amazon_cloud
* <a id="02:56.20">02:56.20 (GMT)</a> - __[j12t](https://github.com/j12t)__: And specifically I need input for this page: https://indieweb.org/Tutorial:_Configure_Known_to_your_liking . But that point in the tutorial the user has installed Known, and has registered for the first account. Now before the first post, what should they do? Eg. turn on Bridgy? What else?

* <a id="10:33.16">10:33.16 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: j12t someone here might know, but if Events aren‚Äôt turned on by default yet, make the tutorial encourage people to turn that on.
* <a id="10:33.16">10:33.16 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: We have had people wonder how to post RSVPs on their Known websites. The functionality was always there, just wasn‚Äôt turned on by default.
* <a id="10:33.16">10:33.16 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: (Maybe there are other post type plugins that aren‚Äôt on by default that people are using a lot? Worth turning on?)

Maybe my emails are landing in a weird place? Possible to set up a call? (http://twtr.io/1ZNASQnsgxM)
* <a id="17:51.40">17:51.40 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Zegnat: I don't see a reason why we can't default this on... I think originally the idea was not to overwhelm people with options, but it does seem the events plugin is more widely used than initially anticipated
* <a id="17:55.14">17:55.14 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: mapkyca, I am probably biased by the IndieWeb viewpoint and do not know about other uses Known is seeing on the education side.
* <a id="17:55.14">17:55.14 (GMT)</a> - __[Zegnat](https://github.com/Zegnat)__: Creating events is definitely not a big use case, but RSVPing is, at least for IndieWeb events.

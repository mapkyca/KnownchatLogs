* <a id="16:59.57">16:59.57 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: mapkyca: the error is "Fatal Error: /home/Idno/Entities/File.php:186 - Allowed memory size of 94371840 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 12096 bytes), on page kimberlyblessing.me/photo/edit/" (using Chrome or Firefox)
* <a id="17:00.11">17:00.11 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: line 186 is in the switch statement for image orientation
* <a id="17:06.38">17:06.38 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: the image i'm trying to upload is vertical/portrait orientation, about 3 mb
* <a id="17:06.53">17:06.53 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: i successfully uploaded a 5 mb landscape orientation image from my desktop just now
* <a id="17:09.09">17:09.09 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: ok, and i successfully uploaded a 3 mb landscape image from my phone. sorry for the misleading info earlier.
* <a id="19:09.16">19:09.16 (GMT)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: kimberly, are they the same file (desktop v mobile) or are you uploading from the camera? It might be running out of memory handling the rotation... if you have access to php config you could try raising memory limits
* <a id="19:31.49">19:31.49 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: mapkyca: i tried the exact same portrait file on both the phone and my computer. the landscape images were different between desktop and mobile, but both worked.
* <a id="20:01.11">20:01.11 (GMT)</a> - __[kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly)__: mapkyca: i temporarily solved this by opening the image in a photo editing tool and saving it -- then it uploaded just fine.

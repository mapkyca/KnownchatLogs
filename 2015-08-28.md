* <a id="16:55.25">16:55.25 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: cute, although my experience of comment spam/login attacks is that they're almost always curl scripts that enumerate the form and then post directly to the form action, so don't load any resources (and so won't load their fancy .js stuff). Nice idea, but I think needs more work...
* <a id="16:56.14">16:56.14 (BST)</a> - __[kylewm](https://github.com/kylewm)__: hmm, other than the topic, there's nothing particularly spammy about https://opportunityforseoexpert.withknown.com/ ... coherent writing, not posting a ton, not a bunch of links

* <a id="16:59.22">16:59.22 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: my fear with known (hosted) and then known (self hosted + social networking stuff finally implemented) is that it becomes a tool of harrasment - e.g. 100000 of sock puppets going after women who have opinions while being on the internet. I'd certainly like to see distributable block lists etc, but I guess that's not directly related...
* <a id="17:04.25">17:04.25 (BST)</a> - __[benwerd](https://github.com/benwerd)__: Yeah, for the record, we're aware of sites like this (we've been passed around in SEO circles) and are watching for now. We also can't proactively cut under safe harbor rules - we're not editorially responsible for content on peoples' Known sites. But a "report" function *is* prudent.

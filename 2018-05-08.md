I can't (re)connect my @Flickr account to my self-hosted #Known site. I enabled the plugin, built an app, but when I click "connect" it only brings me to the @FlickrHelp startpage – no authentication dialogue showing up. (http://twtr.io/1dc6gUFxMqw)
* <a id="14:50.13">14:50.13 (BST)</a> - __[[jeremycherfas]](https://github.com/[jeremycherfas])__: Interesting that jitbit site. They won’t let me use it unless I tweet a link to the page. Which I’m probably not going to do.

Installatron is only updated to 9.2. Last official release is 9.9 and its avaible at @withknown (version I am running). There are newer versions with some bug fixes and features… http://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/05/08/kmapesy-i-do-not-think-reclaimhosting-is-supporting-known-anymore (http://twtr.io/1dckXXCDGSf)

Can you open a support ticket Kristen and we'll take a look? (http://twtr.io/1dckouq1Jw0)

The main issue is the software project doesn't appear to be supported any longer which puts an increased burden on us in terms of support. (http://twtr.io/1dcnZnhp5r1)

* <a id="23:23.21">23:23.21 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I do know Tim and Jim felt a little guilty, even though many told them not to worry, on the number of free installs people did rather then signing up for  a paid plan. But they haven't updated since 0.9.2 bc (I think) they thought project would fold

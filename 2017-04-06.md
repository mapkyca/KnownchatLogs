* <a id="20:45.14">20:45.14 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: hmmmm
* <a id="20:45.38">20:45.38 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I really should get into the weeds of the Known Like & kyle's Reactions plugin
* <a id="20:45.44">20:45.44 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: dgold I'm not sure how/why yours doesn't either. I'm presuming you're uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck.
* <a id="20:45.51">20:45.51 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: there's something not quite right
* <a id="20:45.59">20:45.59 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: several times.
* <a id="20:46.26">20:46.26 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: have you tried it on a fresh install somewhere else to see if it works/doesn't?
* <a id="20:46.51">20:46.51 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: have you tried upping your version of php to 5.6 or more?
* <a id="20:48.27">20:48.27 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: I installed knownreactions the other day on the master branch and had issues on the first two tries (once because I forgot to rename the plugin folder to "Reactions" and it wouldn't enable the plugin) before it worked like I expected.
* <a id="20:48.29">20:48.29 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: now you're talking
* <a id="20:48.57">20:48.57 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: 5.6.29
* <a id="20:48.59">20:48.59 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: sigh
* <a id="20:49.57">20:49.57 (BST)</a> - __[dgold](https://github.com/dgold)__: I'll try *another* fresh install
* <a id="21:12.10">21:12.10 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: tries to think of other simple issues that might cause it not to work properly....
* <a id="21:21.53">21:21.53 (BST)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Time for me to go eat. Will give it a shot tomorrow.
* <a id="21:22.16">21:22.16 (BST)</a> - __[[dgold]](https://github.com/[dgold])__: Did you document what you did to get it working, chrisaldrich?
* <a id="21:27.18">21:27.18 (BST)</a> - __[[chrisaldrich]](https://github.com/[chrisaldrich])__: The primary issue was naming the folder with the app "Reactions" instead of "KnownReactions" that I downloaded as.  The other was an incomplete upload of the folder to my server apparently.

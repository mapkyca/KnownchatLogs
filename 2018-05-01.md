* <a id="12:15.53">12:15.53 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: How to POSSE? External service like IFTTT?
* <a id="13:03.52">13:03.52 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: POSSE to FB? I'm afraid I don't know. I know it is being deprecated on 1 August. For now. I always do it manually. Then I copy the link manually and add it to Syndication Links in WP.
* <a id="13:04.04">13:04.04 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: There is a FB plugin for WithKnown https://github.com/idno/facebook

* <a id="13:04.16">13:04.16 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: I expect it will stop working soon.
* <a id="13:04.51">13:04.51 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: In general, I am against automatic POSSE or cross-posting of anything. The one exception is micro.blog, which gets things from a couple of my feeds.
* <a id="13:17.55">13:17.55 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I love the Twitter Known POSSE I used to pay $60 a year for it even though the idno plug ins were available but that was only way the company monetized at the time and  I liked the team
* <a id="13:18.43">13:18.43 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I still get charged $60 annually but it isn't for a specific service or plug in. Not sure if they will charge next year or if shop is totally folded up
* <a id="13:25.23">13:25.23 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: I have tried a lot of services, but right now I am POSSE-ing with Jetpack from WordPress and I expect that to continue working.
* <a id="13:25.23">13:25.23 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: I was asking about POSSE for Known, as currently I'm doing it to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Micro.Blog, and Mastodon.
* <a id="13:25.23">13:25.23 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: I haven't had a play with Known yet, only installed it, but based on the backend and the simple interface, I certainly plan to use it.
* <a id="13:28.10">13:28.10 (BST)</a> - __[jeremycherfas](https://github.com/jeremycherfas)__: Try the Known FB plugin first.
* <a id="13:58.28">13:58.28 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I can kind of see a future where Known is just my Micropub engine and I connect to it with tools like Indigenous
* <a id="14:00.12">14:00.12 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Though the reply only being available in the status updates in annoying as I can't include images. You can also only POSSE status to Twitter. I need to do article to POSSE to LinkedIn
* <a id="14:01.39">14:01.39 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: I tried micro.blog but I like HTML and not being forced into Markdown and it just feels like it it's built for the iOS crowd
* <a id="14:02.09">14:02.09 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: The idno bookmark (which is also the like) can look ugly
* <a id="14:03.07">14:03.07 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Other than that I love it. I keep trying to mess with the CSS to add some line spacing but haven't got that working yet. Keep trying
* <a id="14:16.46">14:16.46 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: In the comments. The rest of the custom CSS and javascript works well

* <a id="14:57.07">14:57.07 (BST)</a> - __[[unoabraham]](https://github.com/[unoabraham])__: [jgmac1106] Have you had a play with pages and how to customize the homepage? I see your site is WordPress, with Known running on a subdomain.
* <a id="15:04.33">15:04.33 (BST)</a> - __[[jgmac1106]](https://github.com/[jgmac1106])__: Yeah, I also have 37ish different Known Blogs so I can shoe you bunch of different set ups

* <a id="19:58.34">19:58.34 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: Btw, I fixed a bug in the facebook plugin that was preventing it working for some people on signup

* <a id="20:06.24">20:06.24 (BST)</a> - __[mapkyca](https://github.com/mapkyca)__: I might remove that from the readme, it's misleading - it's failing because the travis build seems to have an incompatibility between the mongodb driver for php and the server that's installed, and I've not had time to get to the bottom of it
